<h2>THE LAWS OF LAND.</h2>

<p><em>A Treatise on the Succession to Property vacant by Death.</em> By <span class="smcap">J. R. M'Culloch</span>,
Esq. London: Longmans, 1848.</p>


<p>Mr M'Culloch's book introduces
us to a question much debated in this
age of class jealousy. As soon as we
open it, we are straightway environed
with "a barbarous noise of owls and
cuckoos, asses, apes, and dogs," amid
whose jargon of phrases rises loudest
and most frequent the cry of "commercial
principles." It is a great
grievance, it seems, that land should
not be disposed of according to "commercial
principles;" that hill and holt,
and moor and dale, should not pass
from seller to buyer with the same
readiness as candles and calicoes.
Truly we have enough, and more
than enough, of these same commercial
principles in all walks of thought.
Even the pulpit is not free from them.
Politics are positively smothered with
them. Ethical science, with the shallowisms
of Paley and Bentham round
her neck, struggles feebly with them.
The book-keeper is abroad every
where, with an indestructible faith in
double entry. The Spirit of the Age
wears a pen behind his ear, and sits on
a high stool with three legs. That
the prevailing commercial principles
should have been so long excluded
from the absolute possession of our
laws of land, and that those laws
should have preserved to a time like
this so much of their feudal character,
is a notable proof of the adaptation of
the laws to the general requirements
of the community, and of the steadiness
of that social system which is so
essentially linked to the maintenance
of these laws.</p>

<p>The cry of complaint to which we
have above alluded, is inspired by
many diverse motives. As Mr Cochrane's
ragged followers flocked to Trafalgar
Square to denounce the income-tax,
so many a man takes up the
shout against the law of primogeniture
and entail, as tying up lands and restricting
their sale, who never had the
wherewithal to purchase a single acre
if all broad England was in the market.
On the other hand, the purse-proud
citizen, sore that ready money is not
yet quite at the top of the tree, and
that he does not receive the same consideration
at St James's as in Change
Alley, delights to have some grievance
whereon he can vent his spleen; and
really, in some stolid instances, persuades
himself that he is kept out of
the land which his gold could buy,
through the agency of aristocratical
laws, as if George Robins had been a
mythical personage, or the advertisements
of Farebrother, Clark, and Lye
were a mockery and delusion.</p>

<p>But the largest class of assailants
are those who come to the debate fortified
with certain specious economical
arguments, generally derived from a
one-sided view of some particular
effect of these restrictive laws. To
the demolition of these objectors Mr
M'Culloch's work is more immediately
addressed; and very effectually, in our
opinion, does it accomplish its end.
He has not, perhaps, treated the subject
so widely as it might have been
treated: he has not entered into the
indirect social influences that might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
traced to our system of the laws relating
to land; but the economical
part of the question he has grasped
most completely, and supported by
most able and practical reasoning.</p>

<p>We must, we suppose, look for the
text of the work, not where the text
is usually found, but at the end. The
following sentence, which is almost
the concluding one, may be taken as
the leading proposition of the work:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A powerful and widely-ramified aristocracy
like that of England, not resting
for support on any oppressive laws, and
enjoying no privileges but which are for
the public advantage, is necessary to give
stability and security to the government,
and freedom to the people. And our laws
in regard to succession being well fitted
to maintain such an aristocracy, and, at
the same time, to inspire every other class
with the full spirit of industry and enterprise,
to change them would not be foolish
merely, but criminal,&mdash;a <i lang="FR" xml:lang="FR">lèse majesté</i>
against the public interests."&mdash;P. 172.</p></blockquote>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed
from this remark, that any portion of
the work is appropriated to a set defence
of government by means of an
aristocracy. By an aristocracy we
mean the deposition of political power
in the hands of men of leisure and
education, as opposed to the tendency
of the Reform Bill, to transfer the governing
functions to the "practical"
men of the trading and moneyed interests,
and the analogous claims of
Chartism, founded on Jack Cade's
complaint, that the "king's council
are no good workmen." In England,
we are pretty sure to have an aristocracy&mdash;that
is, the influences which
affect government and legislation will
emanate principally from that class
which is socially at the head of the
nation; and the question is, whether
we are to have a mere moneyed aristocracy,
or one qualified by those mixed
and undefinable conditions which,
more than any thing else, act to keep
down the growing and eager ascendency
of wealth <em>per se</em>. Among the
safeguards of such an aristocracy as
we have described, not the least
powerful is to be found in the laws
discussed in the work before us. Mr
M'Culloch, as we have said, assumes
the importance to the country of preserving
the present characteristics of
British aristocracy; and he therefore
proceeds at once to show how the laws
on which he treats operate for this
preservation, and to rebut the objections
advanced against them on the
score of their relations to other classes
of the community.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent of these
objections is, that the laws in question
tend to diminish the productiveness
of the land, and thereby inflict a
serious injury on the community at
large; that they prevent, in many
instances, the landlord from granting
leases to his tenant beyond the term
of his own life; that the tenant, in
consequence, is not willing to incur
the outlay of drainage and other expensive
improvements, because he is not
secured by a lease; while the landlord,
on the other hand, will not enter into
these expenses, because he does not
feel the same interest in his limited
estate which he would in the unconditional
fee-simple.</p>

<p>Note first of all the logic of this
argument. The tenant, it seems, will
not spend his money in draining without
a lease. As, however, a lease
would suffice to induce him so to do,
we might naturally suppose that the
landlord's estate for life, or in tail,
would be at least an equal inducement.
These reasoners, however,
aver, that the landlord is only to be
tempted by the unrestricted fee. According
to this progressive scale, it
might be fairly, argued, that the tenant,
on becoming lessee for years, would
still require the landlord's life-interest;
and the latter, when seised of the fee,
would decline the requisite expense,
except on a guarantee of immortality,
and justify himself by Horace's authority,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Tanquam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit proprium quidquam puncto quod mobilis horæ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Permutet dominos, et cedat in altera jura."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the general scope of an argument
may be just, though clumsily
stated and fallaciously supported. We
are, however, at no loss for experiments
on the largest scale whereby
to test the theory here noticed. We
have English agriculture, subjected
to a limited law of entail, contrasted
on the one hand with Scottish agriculture,
under a law of perpetual entail,
and on the other with that of
France and its compulsory gavelkind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Mr M'Culloch has taken an elaborate
view of the question in its relation to
the tillage of the soil in these three
countries respectively, more especially
in France. We find, from the result
of his investigation, that,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The average produce per acre of the
crops of wheat in England and Wales in
good years, has been carefully estimated
at thirty-two bushels an acre, and it is
certainly not under thirty bushels. But
in France the produce of wheat, even in
the richest and best cultivated departments,
is little more, according to the
official returns and the best private authorities,
than twenty bushels an acre;
and at an average of the entire kingdom,
it hardly amounts in a good year to fourteen
bushels. This result is completely
decisive. It shows that one acre of land
in England yields, from its being better
farmed, considerably more wheat than
two acres in France: and if we took
barley or oats, turnips, beef, or wool for
a standard, the difference in our favour
would be seen to be still greater....
If labour were taken for a standard instead
of land, the result would be still
more in our favour. One man and one
horse in England produce more corn and
other agricultural produce than three
men and three horses in France. Labour
in the latter is misapplied and
wasted."&mdash;P. 117.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While two husbandmen in France
furnish a surplus of food above their own
consumption adequate for <em>one</em> individual,
the same number of English husbandmen
furnish a surplus for no fewer than <em>four</em>
individuals; showing, that, as measured
by its capacity of providing for the other
classes of the population, English is to
French agriculture as four to one."&mdash;P.
121.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much for the comparison of
French and English agriculture. Let
us now turn to Scotland:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In an Appendix to the 'Sketches of
the History of Man,' published in 1774,
Lord Kames says, 'The quantity of land
that is locked up in Scotland by entails
has damped the growing spirit of agriculture.
There is not produced sufficiency
of corn at home for our consumption; and
our condition will become worse and
worse by new entails, till agriculture and
industry be annihilated.' Now the extent
of land under entail in Scotland has been
certainly more than doubled, perhaps more
than trebled, since this paragraph was
written, and yet agriculture and manufactures
have made a more rapid progress
in Scotland in the interval, and especially
during the last thirty years, when entails
were most prevalent, than in England
or in any other country whatever."&mdash;P.
71.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Kames, in this respect, seems
to have had the same subtle ingenuity
in prophesying counter to the
event, as distinguishes Mr Cobden.</p>

<p>The first part of Mr M'Culloch's
volume contains a cursory historical
view of the earliest regulations of succession
and inheritance. Thus, at
p. 16, he traces the right of primogeniture,
or preference of the eldest
son, to the Mosaic law. We are far
from maintaining that the specific details
of the code promulgated on Sinai
are a model of law for all nations;
on the contrary, they were no doubt
intended to be such as a wise human
law-giver would frame, and consequently
more or less applicable according
to the changes and differences
of social organisation. But we do
hold that these laws indicate to
mankind principles which are to be
observed in all times and by all nations.
Thus, the septennial release
of debts, the return of every man to
his possession in the year of jubilee,
the prohibition of interest upon loans
except to an alien, even the poor
man's portion in the field and vineyard,
may or may not be regulations
adapted to a particular existing state
of society. But they enunciate a
principle of mercy and forbearance
towards the poor and unfortunate, of
which, we fear, our political economists
and commercial legislators are
too apt to lose sight. In conformity
with this view, when we hear the
right of primogeniture assailed as
contrary to the law of nature, (by the
way, where is this much-talked-of
law of nature to be found?) we may
safely appeal to the express recognition
by the Jewish law of "the
right of the first-born as the beginning
of his father's strength," to show
that the custom of primogeniture is at
all events not repugnant to instinctive
justice or the common-sense of mankind.
The old Saxon law of gavelkind
might be better adapted to a
superabundance of land and a thin
population; the preference of the
youngest son, by the custom of Borough-English,
might well prevail
among the far progenitors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Saxon race on the steppes of Scythia,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
when the elder brothers would be
sent forth to roam over the boundless
plain with their flocks and herds, the
youngest remaining at home to be the
prop of his father's old age. But in
a settled and cultivated country, and
among an advanced people, we maintain
succession by primogeniture to
be the most consonant, as a matter of
theory, to the social feelings and requirements
of man; and we think our
author has fully established his position
as to the beneficial character of
its practical results.</p>

<p>In the course of his historical survey,
Mr M'Culloch has of course
touched on the principle of succession
under the Roman law, but more
lightly than we should have expected
in reference to a system which has
entered so largely into our Scottish
law, and which is still accepted as a
model framework of legal principles
in most of the universities of Christendom.
And the slight notice taken
traces an analogy between the feudal
and civil principles of succession,
which we think is altogether incorrect.
Our author, in speaking of the Roman
law of succession, appears to confound
in some measure the Roman term
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæres</i> with the English word <em>heir</em>.
The civilian definition of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæres</i> is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui
ex testamento succedit in universum
jus testatoris</i>. In Scotland the word
<em>heir</em> has much the same import:&mdash;"The
law deems it reasonable," says
Erskine, (<cite>Inst.</cite> book iii. tit. 8, §. 2)
"that every fiar shall have the power
by deed, during his life, to declare
who shall have the lands after his
death: and the person so favoured is
called the <em>heir</em>." Whereas the feudal
notion of the word <em>heir</em> preserved in
the English law, is of one upon whom
the estate is cast, after the death of
his ancestor, by act of law and right
of blood. In other words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæres</i> is he
who is appointed by the will of the
deceased to succeed to his civil rights,
and, in default of such appointment,
the person indicated by a certain
general law. But the <em>heir</em> (in English
law) is the next and worthiest of
blood, appointed by the common-law
to succeed to his ancestor; although
this rule of succession may be set
aside by the appointment or will of
the ancestor, if possessed of the fee-simple.
Bearing in mind this distinction,
we shall perceive the cause of
Mr M'Culloch's error when he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Furian, the Voconian, and the
Falcidian laws were passed, the first two
under the republic, and the latter under
Augustus, to secure the interests of children
by limiting the power of fathers to
make settlements to their prejudice." P. 6.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, the Voconian law, so far from
protecting the interests of children,
frequently operated in the case of
daughters to prejudice them;&mdash;of this
we have a remarkable instance in the
case of Annius Asellus, dwelt upon by
Cicero, in the second action against
Verres, <cite>Orat.</cite> i., c. 41&mdash;44. The law
prevented all registered or assessed
(<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">censi</i>) citizens of Rome from appointing
a female as their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæres</i>. Again,
the Furian and Falcidian laws were
passed to secure the person nominated
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæres</i> from being prejudiced by the
excessive amount of legacies under
the will. Hence, if a man died leaving
only daughters, he was prohibited by
the Voconian law from appointing any
of them as his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæres</i>; and the other two
laws restrained him from appointing
a nominal <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæres</i>, and leaving his property
to his daughters by way of
legacies (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legata</i>.)</p>

<p>In truth, the English notion of heirship,
as succession by right of blood,
seems to be entirely due to the
northern nations and the feudal system.
Under both systems, however,
it is observable how the progress
of legislation and society has been
to increase the privileges and diminish
the duties of the constituted
successor. For as, in tenure by chivalry,
the heir was rather the person
to whom, in consequence of proximity
of blood, the lord might look for the
performance of the military services,
than the fortunate acquirer of the property,
so the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæres</i> was regarded
more in the light of one
on whom devolved the religious, civil,
and private duties of the deceased;
frequently so burdensome that the
inheritance was altogether refused,
until the heir was guarded by such
laws as the Furian and Falcidian.</p>

<p>While we are in the humour of finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
fault, we may notice a passage in
which we think Mr M'Culloch has
not dealt fairly with the English law.
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In one respect the law of intestacy
appears to stand much in need of revision.
It is interpreted so as to give, in
many cases, more to the eldest son than
the real estate and his share of the personalty.
Suppose, for example, that a
person dies intestate, leaving an estate
worth (say) L.100,000, with a mortgage
made by him upon it for half its value, or
£50,000, and leaving also £50,000 of personal
property, in this case the real estate
is obviously worth only £50,000; and
consistently with the principles previously
laid down, the eldest son should succeed
to the estate burdened with its debt,
and the personal property be divided
among the children generally. But a
different rule has been permitted to grow
up. The personal property of persons
dying intestate is the first fund for their
debts, though secured upon their estates;
and it is the surplus only, if there be any,
after these debts are paid, that is divisible
among the children, who, in the above
case, would be entitled to nothing. This
appears to be in all respects a most objectionable
arrangement."&mdash;P. 41.</p></blockquote>

<p>We cannot see any anomaly here.
"It is a rule in equity," says Cruise,
(<cite>Digest</cite>, tit. xv. c. 4,) "that where a
person dies, leaving a variety of funds,
one of which must be charged with a
debt, that the fund which received the
benefit by the contracting the debt
shall make satisfaction." This seems
to us perfectly just and reasonable,
according to the principles of the English
law. In the case put by Mr
M'Culloch, the personalty of £50,000
obviously owes its existence to the
mortgage debt; and it is, therefore,
fairly applied to the discharge of that
debt. But, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cessante ratione, cessat etiam
lex</i>; this only applies where the deceased
was himself the mortgager.
Where the lands came to him mortgaged,
his personal estate will not be
liable, even though he may have made
a covenant to pay it. We may refer
the legal reader to the judgment of
Lord King, delivered, with the assistance
of Lord Chief-Justice Raymond
and the Master of the Rolls, in Evelyn
<em>v.</em> Evelyn, 2 P. Wms. 659. Compare

<p>Although the custom of primogeniture
and the law of entail exercise a
similar influence on our social state, yet,
as they may be said in some measure
to go by a different path towards the
same end, Mr M'Culloch has treated
them separately. With respect to the
first, he begins by rebutting Adam
Smith's sweeping denunciation:&mdash;"Nothing
can be more contrary to the real
interest of a numerous family, than a
right which, in order to enrich one,
beggars all the rest of the children."
<cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>, p. 171.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the contrary," says Mr M'Culloch,
"we are well convinced that much
of the industry and of the superior wealth
and civilisation of modern Europe, may
be ascribed to the influence of the custom
of primogeniture in determining the
succession to estates; and that, were it
abolished, or superseded by the opposite
custom of equally dividing landed property
among all the children, or even
among all the sons, they would suffer
universally by the change, the youngest as
well as the oldest; while it would most
seriously compromise the interests of
every other class."&mdash;P. 28.</p></blockquote>

<p>The truth is, that the right of primogeniture
is rather to be regarded as
having for its object the benefit of the
community, than the interest of the
particular family. If a man has
£50,000 a-year and five sons, it may
appear, at first sight, decidedly more
conducive to "the greatest possible
happiness of the greatest possible
number," that each of these five sons
should have £10,000 a-year, than that
one should possess the whole, or bulk,
of the paternal property, and the other
four be left to buffet their way through
the world. But it is for the interest
of the nation that its aristocracy
should be founded in old families, fortified
and graced by historical associations;
and these are only to be kept
up by a devolution of their lands
according to the feudal rule. But, as
regards the interest of the particular
family, it will appear on consideration
that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred,
this also is most effectually promoted
by the law of primogeniture.
By means of this law, the main stock of
the family is left in its full strength as
a nucleus round which the younger
branches are united, and from which
their members derive alike a great
portion of their status in society, and
inducement to advance themselves in
their respective pursuits; and, on the
other hand, the professions of the
country are exalted and dignified by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the infusion into their ranks of men of
birth and education, who are, at the
same time, dependent on those professions
for their advancement. Sir
Matthew Hale, as quoted by Mr
M'Culloch, forcibly describes the results
of the opposite system. "This
equal division of inheritance," he says,
speaking of the old times of Saxon
gavelkind, "did by degrees bring the
inhabitants to a low kind of country
living; and families were broken; and
the younger sons which, had they not
had these little parcels of land to apply
themselves to, would have betaken
themselves to trades, or to military,
or civil, or ecclesiastical employments,
neglecting those opportunities, wholly
applied themselves to those small divisions
of land; whereby they neglected
the opportunities of greater advantage
of enriching themselves and the kingdom."
And if it should be urged that
Sir Matthew Hale could do little more
than form an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> judgment of the
social condition of England in the
days of the Confessor, it should be
remembered that the picture here
drawn is precisely applicable to the
state of France at the present day,
and may easily be traced to its similar
system of partition. An important
public result of the same system, as
regards the landholders in the exercise
of their functions as citizens, may also
be observed in that country. The
large body of landed proprietors,
amounting to between four and five
millions, so far from being the leaders
of the people, are, perhaps, the most
inert and uninfluential class of the
whole community. They pay the bulk
of the taxes, and grumble accordingly;
but beyond a vague dread of aristocracy&mdash;not
unnaturally founded, perhaps,
on the traditions of the vexatious
privileges swept away in 1791&mdash;they
seem disposed calmly to acquiesce
in all the proclamations, charters, and
chimeras that maybe thrust upon them
by busier handlers of the tools of
government, and behold revolutions
concocted in Paris, and bursting over
their heads, apparently without the
remotest conception that it any wise
rests with them to control or guide
the convulsion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has sometimes been contended that
the custom of primogeniture is injurious,
from its interesting the leading families
of the country in the support of expensive
public establishments, in which their
younger branches are most commonly
placed."&mdash;P. 38.</p></blockquote>

<p>This objection also Mr M'Culloch
brings to the test of experiment, and
shows that this bias, if it really exist,
is little perceptible, and that the aristocracy
have shown much more zeal
to discharge the functions of the ill-paid
offices of the army and navy,
than to get into their hands the lucrative
situations connected with the
administration of justice. It was certainly
not the immediate interest of
the aristocracy, for instance, to maintain
the offices of the six clerks in
Chancery, the profits on which were
estimated for compensation at sums
varying, we believe, from £2500 to
£1000 per annum.</p>

<p>The law of entail is traceable to the
same human instincts as the law of
primogeniture. The clannish feelings
of the northern nations, their notion
of representation by blood, and the
territorial character of their citizenship,
all combined to produce an anxiety
to perpetuate the old stocks in
the homes of their fathers. Nor is this
desire of posthumous control over the
transmission of lands the product, as
is sometimes alleged, of an artificial
state of society. Man's possessory
instinct essentially connects itself with
the future&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Serit arbores quæ alteri
prosint sæculo.</i> The justice of gratifying
this wish by general laws of the
community is not more impeachable
than that of guarding the indefeasible
possession of the owner during his
lifetime. It remains to be seen how
far the sanction of entails is consistent
with the good of the nation in
general.</p>

<p>Every lawyer knows that the progress
of legal decisions in England has
been adverse to entails, and that
although the statute De Donis continues
on the statute-book, yet it was
long ago rendered almost nugatory by
the introduction of fines and recoveries.
Hence the term entail is now
popularly applied to denote the strict
settlement of lands, under provisions
which prevent them from passing from
the heirs to whom they are limited;
this having been, of old, the result of
an entail properly so called, though it
now requires a more complicated mode
of settling, and can only endure (so as
to render the lands inalienable) for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
life or any number of lives in being,
and twenty-one years afterwards.
This more popular meaning of the
word entail is that which Mr M'Culloch
follows&mdash;his object being to treat
of the influence of tying up lands from
alienation.</p>

<p>Measuring the practice of entails
by the rule of utility, Mr M'Culloch
selects two points as the principal
topics of discussion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the first place, it is alleged in favour
of entails that they stimulate exertion
and economy; that they hold out to
industry and ambition the strongest and
safest excitement in the prospect of founding
an imperishable name and a powerful
family, and of being remembered and
venerated by endless generations as their
chief and benefactor. And, in the second
place, it is said that entails form the only
solid bulwark of a respectable aristocracy,
and prevent generations from being
ruined by the folly or misfortunes of an
individual."&mdash;P. 78.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first of these propositions is, no
doubt, partially true; but the motive
put forward has not, we think, as a
matter of experience, the force that
might, at first sight, be attributed to
it. Perhaps the keenest accumulators
of wealth have not been those who
have fixed their capital in a landed
estate. The man of business habits
and judicious speculation is drawn to
make his fortune in obedience to a
passion which is partly developed, and
at all events fostered, by the pursuit
of his life. It cannot be said to arise
altogether from a notion of benefiting
posterity, of being the founder of a
house&mdash;the man of whom future Fitztomkynses
shall be ashamed&mdash;that
John Tomkins, merchant, sets at
nought all the expostulations of self-indulgence:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tun' mare transilias? tibi tortâ cannabe fulto<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cœna sit in transtro? Veientanumque rubellum<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Exhalet vapidâ læsum pice fissilis obba?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">Enormous fortunes were accumulated
during the declining days of the Roman
republic. But entails being then
unknown, and the Roman nobility
having no territorial position, these
fortunes, usually acquired by oppression
and extortion in the provinces,
were squandered in largesses and corruption
at home. There was no other
way in which a Roman citizen of
great wealth could establish the influence
of his family. He could not, like,
all English gentleman, connect his
name with a landed estate, and extend
his influence by those good offices and
local duties which lie so immediately
open to a man in that capacity. As
an almost necessary consequence, he
sought for power through the demoralisation
and corruption of the holders
of the suffrage&mdash;causes which contributed
more than any other to the
downfall of the republic. By lavishing
his gold in this manner, he obtained,
not only political eminence for himself,
but also that power which led
to proconsulates and proprætorships
among his heirs, and thus gave them
the opportunity of repairing, by fresh
exactions, his diminished revenues.</p>

<p>Hence we should rather view the
law of entail as an inducement to a
man to perpetuate his thousands in
broad acres than to acquire his fortune
in the first instance. And, in conformity
with this view, it may be observed,
that it is more generally the
son or other successor than the architect
of the fortune himself who converts
the accumulated wealth into this
permanent form.</p>

<p>Mr M'Culloch's second point&mdash;the
preservation of families by means of
entails&mdash;is one of wider interest and
more general importance. In a bustling
mercantile community like ours,
we cannot too jealously guard any
institution which, directly or indirectly,
tends to preserve distinctions
due to something more than mere
wealth. And there can be no doubt
that the system of entails has saved
many an ancient line from being
thrust from its home of centuries to a
strange spot, and this not only among
the titled and wealthy, but among the
yeomanry and "statesmen." In England,
of course, a family may frequently
perish through the possession
of an estate in fee-simple passing into
the hands of an unthrifty representative
of the line, as the settlements require
constant renewal. But in Scotland
the system of perpetual entail
exercises a much more potent influence
in their behalf. Mr M'Culloch,
though he rebuts many of the objections
urged against the Scottish law, is
nevertheless anxious to see it assimilated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in a great measure to that of
England. There is, however, an exception
which he would make to the
rule against perpetuity of entails. It
is with regard to the peerage, in which
matter we cordially agree with him.
There were, in ancient times, instances
of barons who were degraded from
their dignity on account of their lack
of sufficient revenue to support their
hereditary title. The independence
and the dignity of the House of Lords
would be alike maintained by an enactment
enabling, or even obliging, all
peers to tie up by perpetual entail a
certain portion of their estates to
accompany the title. Such anomalies
as that of an Earl of Buchan (Lord
Erskine's father, see Lord Campbell's
<cite>Lives of the Chancellors</cite>) living in the
uppermost flat of a sixteen-story
house, would thereby be avoided with
considerable advantage to the national
interests.</p>

<p>Mr M'Culloch, therefore, who quotes
Sir William Temple and Dr Johnson
on the same side, would preserve the
law of perpetual entail for the Scottish
peerage, and extend it also to
that of England. In other respects he
is, as we have above stated, in favour
of a considerable modification of the
Scottish law of entail. He admits,
however, the difficulty of dealing with
existing entails.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These have established a right of
property not only in the actual possessors
and their families, but, speaking generally,
in a wide circle of collateral heirs;
nor could the rights of the unborn heirs
be affected without annulling the clauses
in a great number of settlements, and also
in marriage-contracts and other deeds
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter vivos</i>. It is, therefore, hardly possible
materially to relax the fetters of
entails with strict justice to all parties,
though it might perhaps be slowly and
gradually effected without inflicting any
very serious hardship on any individual.
We incline to think that this might be
most easily brought about by saving the
rights of living heirs of entail, and of
such heirs as may be born under existing
marriage-contracts. The interests of the
possible heirs that might be prejudiced by
the adoption of some such rule as this,
are of so very unsubstantial a description
that they might safely be neglected."
P. 78.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the time we write, a measure is
pending before Parliament, entitled
"A Bill for the amendment of the Law
of Entail in Scotland," and endorsed
with the names of the Lord-Advocate,
Sir George Grey, and Mr Solicitor-General
for Scotland. Whatever difficulties
Mr M'Culloch feels with regard
to relaxing the fetters of entail, it is
obvious that the contrivers of this bill
are in nowise hampered by them. They
go to work in the most off-hand manner
possible. A short and unobtrusive-looking
bill is to drive clean through
all the existing settlements and deeds
of tailzie, with their complicated train
of clauses irritant and resolutive, as if
no mortal was concerned in the
matter, and estates were the proper
toys of law-makers.</p>

<p>The fact of the quantity of alienable
land diminishing in a commercial
country, while trade and population
are increasing, is no doubt a state of
things which calls for a remedy, since
there must at some period or another,
be a failure of land adequate to meet
the requirements of realised fortunes.
If, in the judgment of reasonable and
practical observers, the difficulty could
be met by making all future entails
subject to be barred by a process
analogous to that existing in England,
we should think there could be no
hesitation in affirming it to be the
most just and most expedient course
to introduce such a change, and leave
the existing settlements in their contemplated
perpetuity. If, however, it
can be clearly established that already
too much land is locked up in the
northern kingdom, and that the soil
now free from entail is insufficient to
satisfy the requirements of future
buyers, then we should say that the
utmost care and skill were required
in framing enactments which should
adapt themselves to the justice of
particular cases, and should, as far
as might be, save existing and vested
interests in their delicate multiplicity
and connexion. If ever such care and
skill were required, it would be in a
measure which interferes more extensively
with vested rights&mdash;usually with
good reason a sacred thing in the eye
of the law&mdash;than any which appears in
the statute-books of the three kingdoms.
A statute to convert the Irish
tenants into owners of the fee-simple
of their several holdings, (a project
which has been talked of,) would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
scarcely be a more startling invasion
of the rights of property as they are
usually recognised. We do not, however,
intend to impeach the general
provisions of the bill. If, as we before
observed, so important a change was
found to be necessary, it is right to
make it; and it is no more than was
effected in England by a more gradual
process&mdash;the subtle fictions of the law-courts,
which virtually got rid of the
statute De Donis. But we can anticipate
nothing but uncertainty and
multiplied litigation, from the apparently
crude and careless project now
before us.</p>

<p>An instance of the loose wording of
this bill strikes the reader in the very
first section. It proposes to enact
"that where any estate in Scotland
shall be entailed by a deed of tailzie,
dated on or after the first day of
March one thousand eight hundred and
forty-eight, it shall be lawful for any
heir of entail, born after the date of
such tailzie, being of full age, and in
possession of such entailed estate in
virtue of such tailzie, <em>to acquire such
estate in fee-simple</em>, by applying to the
Court of Session, &amp;c." Now, what is
this estate which the heir of entail is
to acquire in fee-simple? The estate-tail,
for so it is by hypothesis. But to
talk of acquiring an estate-tail in fee-simple
is nothing better than downright
nonsense. An estate-tail is, by
the origin of the word, cut or carved
(taillé) out of the fee-simple. You
may talk of converting or enlarging
the part into the whole, but you cannot
talk of acquiring the part in the
entirety of the whole. This is not all;
the bill plunges at once <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in medias res</i>,
without favouring us with any sort of
definition of the important phrase,
"heir of entail," in this and other
clauses. The same expression in
the statute 1 Jac. VII. c. 32, has
already (see <cite>Sandford's Entails</cite>, p.
231) given rise to no small questioning
and litigation, which promise to
be renewed in abundance should this
measure pass into a law. Again, perpetual
inalienability is not an incident
to all estates-tail. Lands merely
bound by what are called the prohibitive
clauses, may be alienated for a
valuable consideration, though not by
a voluntary or (as the Scotch say)
gratuitous conveyance. Tailzies, however,
to which no clauses are annexed,
do not prevent the heir from conveying
the lands in any manner he
pleases. Now, as, the object of this
bill is to relax the bonds of perpetual
inalienability, we presume that only
those tailzies which are guarded by
the irritant and resolutive clauses are
within its purview. If so, the general
expression "deed of tailzie" should
have been distinctly limited. If that
expression should be held to comprehend
all deeds of tailzie, which it must
of course do when taken by itself, then
the proposed act will exercise a very
extensive disabling power, by restricting
the unlimited right of alienation
under tailzies of simple destination,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and the right of alienation
for value under tailzies with prohibitive
clauses only introduced, to the
peculiar form and instrument pointed
out by this bill, and which we suppose
was devised in analogy to the
forms substituted for fines and recoveries
by the statute 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV.
c. 74.</p>

<p>We have already seen how Mr
M'Culloch would deal with the difficulty
of disturbing the devolution of
lands already limited in perpetual
entail&mdash;namely, by "saving the rights
of living heirs of entail, and of heirs
born under existing marriage-contracts."
We think our author has
not, in this passage, expressed himself
with due legal perspicuity and
precision. The phrase "living heirs
of entail" is somewhat vague and uncertain;
we presume Mr M'Culloch
intended the living issue of the heir
of entail in possession, and all living
heirs-substitute and their living issue.
Again, what are existing marriage-contracts?
Probably those marriage-contracts
are intended, which are
annexed to marriages solemnised
before the introduction of a new
system. Both these suggestions, as
we have interpreted them, might
with justice, and advantage have
formed part of the new law. It is
true that this would, at all events
for a considerable period of time, stop
short of that assimilation of the Scottish
law to the English which seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to have been a great object with the
framers of this bill. But the two
systems would gradually correspond;
and we hold that there is a principle
of justice involved in the upholding
of contracts the objects of which are
as yet unfulfilled. Where an English
settler has limited lands to a man for
life, remainder to his first and other
sons successively in tail, he knew, at
the time of making the settlement,
that it was liable to be barred with
consent of the eldest son on his coming
of age. But it was not so with a
Scotch settler who executed a deed of
tailzie to several brothers as successive
heirs-substitute; and the legislature
has no right, without the gravest
public cause, to step in and defeat his
intention.</p>

<p>But the bill, though intending to
give far greater liberty to the owner
of an entailed estate than Mr M'Culloch
does, or, as we think, is consistent
with justice, sets about affording him
aid in the most ambiguous and misty
manner conceivable. The 2d clause
enacts that the heir of entail in possession,
born after the date of the act,
may disentail in the manner provided
by the act; and an heir of entail born
before the date of the act may similarly
disentail, "with the consent (and
not otherwise) of the heir-substitute
next in succession, and heir-apparent
under the entail of the heir in possession,"
he being born after the date of
the act, and capable of contracting.</p>

<p>We should recommend the tenant
in tail to be very cautious how he
attempts to "acquire his estate in
fee-simple" under the provisions of
this clause. He is to obtain the consent
of the heir-substitute next in succession.
So far his course is clear.
But the same person is also designated
by the term "heir-apparent under the
entail of the heir in possession." Now,
is this a qualification of the general
term "heir-substitute next in succession,"
and must such person, under
the act, be also heir-apparent? If so,
what is the particular qualification
required of him under the expression
"heir-apparent?" Adhering to the
use of the phrase in popular language,
we must take, as the only circumstances
under which the next heir-substitute
and the heir-apparent are
one and the same person, the case in
which the first estate under the entail
is limited to a man and the heirs of
his body, and the second to his second
son and the heirs of his body; then,
supposing the eldest son to die in the
lifetime of his father, the second son
would be both the next heir-substitute
and also the heir-apparent. Is this,
therefore, the only case within the
act? Scarcely, we should think, was
it so intended. Are we, then, to interpret
the word heir-apparent in the
sense in which the phrase heir-presumptive
is generally used; and must
we suppose that the cases indicated
are those in which there is no issue
under the first entail, and therefore
the next heir-substitute is what we
should call heir-presumptive to the
person in possession? If so, what is
to become of the numerous cases where
there is issue to take under the existing
estate-tail? Or can it be that the
issue in tail is altogether forgotten by
this act, and that the person whose
consent is required is merely the next
heir-substitute in any case? We are
inclined to think this the most probable
explanation of this unfortunate
clause, but can scarcely imagine that
it will be suffered to pass into a law.
A further ambiguity, however, arises
with respect to this term heir-apparent,
from its having a peculiar technical
meaning in the Scottish law.
"He who is entitled," says Erskine,
"to enter heir to a deceased ancestor
is, before his actual entry, styled, both
in our statutes and by our writers,
<em>apparent heir</em>." If the bill intends
any reference to this legal acceptation
of the phrase, we can only understand
the person whose consent is required,
to be such person as, being next heir-substitute,
would, on the immediate
decease of the possessor, be his apparent
heir, or entitled to enter on the
lands. This, again, shuts out all those
estates where the possessor has issue
in tail, and would, consequently, limit
the operation of the bill to exceptional
cases. We think we have said enough
to convince our readers that this clause
is not likely to set free many entailed
estates in Scotland&mdash;at all events, not
without a chaos of litigation, in which
the elements of profit will have a tendency
to range themselves on the side
of the lawyers.</p>

<p>The person whose consent is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
obtained (whoever that mysterious
person may be) is, as we have seen,
to be born after the date of the act.
In conformity with this principle, one
would have supposed that where the
next heir-substitute shall have been
born before that date, then it should
be necessary to obtain the consent of
the first person entitled to take <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
formam doni</i>, who shall be born after
this date, together with the consent of
all those who are to take before him.
The third clause, however, introduces
a new form of protection to the settlement,
and merely enacts that, in such
cases, the consent of a certain number
of the heirs-substitute is to be obtained,
(the blank left for the number
was filled up with the word "three"
in committee of the House of Commons.
Nothing said about the issue
in tail, as before.</p>

<p>Where the main enactments of the
bill are so incomprehensible, it is useless
to dwell on its details. We can
only say, that whatever evils may be
shown to exist under the present law,
they will not only fail to be cured, but
must be aggravated tenfold, by such a
product of off-hand legislation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Sent before its time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that so lamely and unfashionable,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">that it must necessarily die of its own
deformity, unless the law-courts will
lick it into shape by their decisions,&mdash;a
shape (as it must be) in which its
own parents would not know it again.</p>

<p>The law of real property in France
exhibits a system so distinctly antagonistic
to our English and Scottish
law of entail, that we cannot be surprised
at the attention with which Mr
M'Culloch has investigated its influences.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"According to the law of France, a
person with one child may dispose at
pleasure of a moiety of his property, the
child inheriting the other moiety as legitim,
or matter of right; a person having
two children can only dispose of a third
part of his property; and those having
more than two must divide three-fourths
of their property equally amongst them,
one-fourth part being all that is then left
at their disposal. When a father dies intestate,
his property is equally divided
among his children, without respect to sex
or seniority. Nothing can be more distinctly
opposed to the principles we have
endeavoured to establish, and to the system
followed in this country, than this
law. It is therefore lucky that it is now
no novelty. It has been established for
more than half a century, so that we may
trace and exhibit its practical influence
over the condition of the extensive population
subject to its operation. Such an
experiment is of rare occurrence, but
when made is invaluable. And if its results
should confirm the conclusions already
come to, it will go far to establish them
on an unassailable basis."&mdash;P. 80-81.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have already seen how these
results may be traced in the state of
French agriculture. They may also,
we think, be discerned in the relative
position which the landholders of
France bear to other classes in the
social scale. These, numbering between
four and five millions, ought,
as a class, to constitute the leaders of
the nation. So far from this being the
case, they are perhaps the most inert
and uninfluential portion of the community,
having apparently had little
or no voice in the two revolutions
which have swept over their heads
within the last eighteen years, and as
little in the erection, maintenance, or
downfall of the Throne of the Barricades.
It yet remains to be seen
whether they will continue to accept
every thing which the clubs of Paris
are willing to force upon them. As
tax-payers and cultivators of the soil,
it can hardly suit them to be propagandists;
as men who have something
to lose, they will not readily give in
to the dictatorial vagaries of Ledru
Rollin. If, however, they would hold
their own, it is time for them to be up
and doing. France has been governed
by a minority before now.</p>

<p>We have always regarded it as one
of the main advantages of a landed
aristocracy, that it raises up a principle
of social rank antagonistic to
that of mere wealth. In France, the
constant subdivision and transfer of
land breaks down this influence, and
causes land to be regarded as a mere
marketable article and equivalent for
money.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In countries where the custom of
primogeniture exercises a powerful influence,
families become identified with
estates&mdash;the family representing the estate,
and the estate the family. The
wealth and consideration enjoyed by the
latter depend upon, and are intimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
connected with, the possession of the lands
which have descended to them from their
ancestors. They estimate their value by
another than a mere pecuniary standard.
They are attached to them by the oldest
and most endearing associations; and they
are seldom parted with except under the
most painful circumstances. Hence the
perpetuity of property in England in the
same families, notwithstanding the limited
duration of entails; great numbers of
estates being at this moment enjoyed by
those whose ancestors acquired them at or
soon after the Conquest. But in France
such feelings are proscribed. Estates and
families have there no abiding connexion;
and at the demise of an individual who
has a number of children, his estate can
hardly escape being subdivided. And
this effect of the law tends to imbue the
proprietors with corresponding sentiments
and feelings. 'Non seulement,' says M.
De Tocqueville, 'la loi des successions
rend difficile aux familles de conserver
intacts les mêmes domaines, mais elle leur
òte le désir de le tenter, et elle les entraîne,
en quelque sorte, à coopérer avec
elle à leur propre ruine.'"&mdash;P. 85-86.</p></blockquote>

<p>But Mr M'Culloch dwells more particularly
on the injurious effects to
agriculture from the parcelling out of
the land into small properties. He
shows that a small proprietor is not
so efficient a cultivator of the soil as a
tenant, in which doctrine Arthur
Young had preceded him. He shows,
also, that the subdivision of properties
leads to the subdivision of farms, and
urges that it is impossible to have good
farming on small patches of land. Of
the miseries of an agricultural system
carried on by small farmers on petty
holdings, we have already a sufficient
example in Ireland. We cannot but
think, however, that the progress of
things in England has too much swallowed
up those little farms of from
thirty to fifty acres, which at one time
were common over the country. Not
but what capital is employed at a
great disadvantage on these little holdings&mdash;but
where there is a general system
of good-sized farms, an intermixture,
of smaller farms is not attended
with injurious effects proportional to
those which arise where the whole of
the land is split up into minute parcels.
And then small farmers furnish a link
between the yeomanry and peasantry,
which it is useful to maintain, cheering
the poor man's lot by pointing out to
him a path by which lie may advance
from the position of a day-labourer to
that of an occupier of land. On the
same principle, we are rejoiced to observe
the gradual extension of the allotment
system; although it would
have a still more beneficial effect, we
think, if the land was granted in the
shape of a croft about the cottage,
thus giving the tenant a greater interest,
and more individual sense of proprietorship,
than when his piece of
land is packed, along with a number
of others, into a mass of unsightly
patches.</p>

<p>In connexion with the small holdings
in Ireland, it should not be forgotten
that this subdivision of the
land results mainly from the practice
of sub-letting; and this again has
arisen in a great degree from the
practice of granting long leases,
the want of which in England has
served, among many other things, for
an outcry against the landlords. Mr
M'Culloch has pointed out the evils of
too long leases on the farming tenant,
that they superinduce a sense of security
which easily degenerates into
indolence. But the influence on Ireland
is even worse, by breaking up
the land into small patches, on which
the occupier can but just maintain
himself, paying an exorbitant rent to
the middleman. For it is not the
eager demand for land amongst the
Irish peasantry, as we sometimes
hear, that has produced this subdivision
of the land, but the subdivision
that has produced the demand, by
putting the cultivation of the land
into the hands of a class who are
unable, through want of skill and
capital, to carry it on; who cannot,
therefore, furnish employment for the
labourers, and thus drive them to
grasp at little parcels of land as their
only means of securing a wretched
subsistence; and this security, as we
know, has more than once proved but
a fancied one, as in the disastrous
failure of the potato crop.</p>

<p>While we are on this subject, we
may draw the reader's attention to a
very able pamphlet by an Irish gentleman,
on Irish matters, which,
though we believe it has never been
published, has had an extensive private
circulation. We allude to "An
Address to the Members of the House,
of Commons on the Landlord and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Tenant Question, by Warren H. R.
Jackson, Esq." The work, though
somewhat tinged with the hard politico-economical
school, is written
with great shrewdness of thought and
freedom from prejudice, and is well
worthy the careful attention of the
honourable House. The writer, in
discussing the vexed question he has
taken in hand, fully coincides with
the general principles laid down by
Mr M'Culloch. "This," he says,
(speaking of the subdivision of land)
"is one of the monster grievances of
Ireland, and you will do little good
unless you abate it." This abatement
he would bring about mainly
by prospective laws, as by placing all
contracts for subletting <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hors la loi</i>,
and so taking away from the first
lessee all power of recovering his rent
from the actual tenant. We cannot
but think that this would be found a
most salutary enactment. It should
be remembered, that the occupier is
responsible to the owner of the freehold
by the power of distress vested
in the latter, and it is but just that
he should be relieved from the liability
to pay two rents&mdash;a liability which it
is manifest no good farmer would incur,
but which the squalid ravager of
the soil in Ireland is always eager
for.</p>

<p>It has been said that no further
legislative enactment is required in
Ireland, and that administrative wisdom
must do what yet remains to be
done. Mr Jackson, however, shows
that there are such deep-seated evils
in Ireland as cannot be cured except
by the direct interference of the legislature.
But we think he expects too
much from the Sale of Encumbered
Estates Bill. An extensive change
of proprietorship would, we are persuaded,
be a great evil in Ireland.
There is an attachment in general to
the "ould stock" among their poorer
neighbours, which would naturally be
followed by a jealousy and prejudice
against the new comers who displaced
them. And this prejudice would of
itself neutralise any efforts for improvement
which the landlord might otherwise
be disposed to make&mdash;although,
in most cases, we should not expect
much effort in this direction from a
stranger mortgagee, often an unwilling
purchaser, who would naturally
be anxious to contract with those
parties from whom he could obtain his
rents with least trouble, leaving them
to deal with the land as they liked,
and thereby continuing and increasing
the odious middleman system.</p>

<p>Mr M'Culloch does not confine his
examination of the compulsory partition
in France to its influence on
agriculture. He has discerned certain
political effects of that and the concomitant
system of which it is a part,
with a precision which subsequent
events have elevated into a sort of
prophecy. The preface to his work is
dated December 1847, and the work
was published, we believe, early in
January. There can, therefore, be no
grounds for classing the following passage
with those anticipations which
are made after the event:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The aristocratical element is no longer
to be found in French society; and the
compulsory division of the soil, while it
prevents the growth of an aristocracy,
impresses the same character of mobility
upon landed possessions that is impressed
on the families of their occupiers. Hence
the prevalent want of confidence in the
continuance of the present order of things
in France. What is there in that country
to oppose an effectual resistance to a
revolutionary movement? Monarchy in
France has been stripped of those old associations
and powerful bulwarks whence
it derives almost all its lustre and support
in this and other countries. The
throne stands in solitary, though not
unenvied dignity, without the shelter of
a single eminence, exposed to the full
force of the furious blasts that sweep
from every point of the surrounding
level. There is nothing intermediate,
nothing to hinder a hostile majority in the
Chamber of Deputies from at once subverting
the regal branch of the constitution,
or changing the reigning dynasty."&mdash;P.
132-133.</p></blockquote>

<p>Scarcely was the printer's ink dry
on this passage when the Throne of
the Barricades was gone. We have
given our author full credit for his
sagacity in penetrating into the future,
but we think it would puzzle him to
foretell what is to come next. We
are disposed to doubt, however, whether
an aristocracy could have preserved
the throne of Louis Philippe.
It is true that in our own country
William of Nassau and George of
Brunswick maintained their crowns by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the aid of powerful sections of the
nobility. But the revolutions which
gave them those crowns were not the
volcanic outbursts of popular force.
Under such outbursts, no successful
usurper, no "Hero-king," no sovereign
by the will of the people, has
been able to devise a principle which
shall establish his throne in security,
and serve in the stead of that prestige
of old hereditary succession, that
grand feudal idea of kingly right,
which is the essential fountain of
the reverence that guards royalty.
Louis Philippe would have confirmed
his sovereignty by means of the
influence exerted upon interested
officials. No sooner was his power
shaken in its unstable equilibrium
than the men whom his gold had
bought rushed to worship the rising
sun of the young Republic. Napoleon,
before him, would have built up
a similar power on military glory:
his doom was sealed when his eagles
turned from the field of Leipsic.
Cromwell employed religious fanaticism
to the same end: the fanaticism
lasted his time; but we will venture
to say that, had he lived, his protectorate
would not have reached the
seventeen years allotted to the democratic
King of the French.</p>

<p>Our author is of opinion that, after
all, the system of compulsory partition
will fail to guard what has since
become the French Republic:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But, though it were possible, which
it is not, to obviate the mischievous
influence of the French and other plans
for preventing the increase and continuance
of property in the same families,
it may be confidently predicted that
they will, in time to come as hitherto,
wholly fail in their grand object of perpetuating
the ascendancy of the democracy.
In old settled and fully peopled
countries, where the bulk of the population
is necessarily poor and dependent,
an aristocracy is indispensable for the
support of a free system of government&mdash;'Il
importe à tous les peuples qui ont la
prétention de devenir ou de rester puissants,
d'avoir une aristocratie, c'est-à-dire
un corps héréditaire ou non, qui conserve
et perpetue les traditions, donne de
l'esprit de suite à la politique, et se voue
à l'art le plus difficile de tous, qu'
aujourd'hui cependant tout le monde
croit savoir sans l'avoir appris, celui de
gouverner. Un peuple sans aristocratic
pourra briller dans les lettres et les arts,
mais sa gloire politique me semble
devoir être passagère comme un méteore.'
<span class="smcap">Chevalier</span>, <cite>Lettres sur l'Amerique</cite>, ii.
379," pp. 171, 172.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have already said that we
think England certain to have an
aristocracy of some description. The
ambition of the people to advance
themselves individually in the social
scale will necessarily lead to a high
value being set upon those advanced
positions, and will tend to make them
the fulcrum from which the country is
governed. And we can conceive
nothing more fatal to our national
organisation than the result which
would follow indirectly from the repeal
of these laws. It may be supposed
at first sight that no very vital
question is involved here. Let those
who suppose so, take a view of the
probable condition of society which
would ensue. These, and other so-called
feudalities, being swept away,
land becomes a commercial article,
according to the desire of the plutocratic
reformers. Estates are trucked
about in the market like bills of exchange;
constantly changing hands,
their owners have little connexion
with them or the people that live on
them, regarding them merely in the
light of so much realised capital. The
old families gradually become dispossessed;
mere wealth is recognised
as the sole qualification for rank and
influence; and the leading class in
the state is composed of men who are
an aristocracy by virtue of ready
money. Far be it from us to undervalue
the enterprise, integrity, and
industry of our merchant manufacturers
and tradesmen. But we will
say that when we meet with a man,
as we often do among those classes,
endowed with a broad range of
thought and high and noble aims,
we regard him as possessing these
qualities not as a consequence, but
in spite of a commercial training.
The immediate effects of such training
are to narrow the mind and
cramp the soul, not in respect of
domestic and social life&mdash;for in these,
perhaps, the middle classes are unsurpassed
by any other&mdash;but in the provinces
of the statesman and the
politician.</p>

<p>In these times, it seems to be commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
supposed that a legislator&mdash;like
a poet&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nascitur, non fit</i>. There is a
certain kind of training, the acquisition
of a certain cast of thought, which
are requisites for statesmen as a class,
as much as his legal reading for a lawyer,
or his apprenticeship for a handicraftsman.
Statesmen, however, have
to deal with practical matters; and
therefore we think, as we have before
said, that while the predominance of
these requisites in the legislature is
essential to good government, there
may with advantage at the same time
be a certain admixture of the men
practically versed in commerce and
manufactures. But this should be always
a subordinate, not a leading, element
in the principles which regulate
the administration of government.&mdash;We
repeat, that the counting-house,
the loom, and the anvil, are not the
best schools for legislators. For that
office, a man requires leisure and education.
We shall be told that a
"Squire" is not necessarily an educated
man. We do not maintain that
he is. But, in the first place, as we
cannot well have an education-test,
we must go to the class in which, as a
class, we find the highest and most
enlarged form of education; and we
believe that this qualification can,
without question, be claimed for the
leisure-class, or gentlemen of England.
In the second place, it should
be remembered, that if the squire is
not always individually what we
should call an educated man, he yet
imbibes his thoughts and notions from
those who are such, who give tone to
the society in which he moves. In
investigating the characteristics of
classes, it can scarcely be but that a
number of exceptions to our general
rules will force themselves upon our
attention. Yet, in good truth, we believe
that almost all the individual
examples which can be cited will bear
out our estimate. The highest contributions
to the legislature, on the
part of the middle or commercial
classes, have been the shrewd practical
men of business, men of the stamp
of Mr Hawes. As for the Cobdens
and Brights, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et hoc genus omne</i>, their
only motive principle appears to be
the interests of <em>My Shop</em>. Their notion
of loyalty, patriotism, and British
prosperity, is nothing but low wages,
high profits, and a brisk trade in calicoes.</p>

<p>Many of our readers will recollect
a passage in Cicero, (<cite>Off.</cite> i. 42,) in
which he reprobates, more or less, all
commercial pursuits, in respect of their
operations on the moral insight of
man, and finishes with the praise of
the culture of the soil, in these words:
"Omnium rerum ex quibus aliquid
acquiritur, nihil est agriculturâ meliùs,
nihil uberiùs, nihil dulciùs, nihil homine
libero digniùs." In this country we
should find it difficult to go along
with the feelings of the old Roman
republican on these points. But
though we have already expressed
our high sense of the social and domestic
virtues of the middle or
trading classes, yet we are most confident
in the truth of our position,
that the shop is the worst possible
preparation for the senate. We know
that there is a talk abroad about
earnest workers, drones of the hive,
and so forth. By all means, let every
man work who is fit to work. But it
is not necessary, nor is it desirable,
that every man should work for gain.
On the contrary, we hold that a class
endowed with leisure is indispensable,
not only for the grace and civilisation,
but even for the moral well-being of
a community. That money should
become the one grand loadstar of
thought and action is the bane of
those societies where the pursuit of
money is the general employment;
but where there is such a leisure-class
as we have spoken of, forming the
topmost rank of a nation otherwise
chiefly mercantile, there are numberless
influences derived from it which
percolate through the underlying
masses, and check or modify the
exclusive reverence for wealth to
which they would otherwise be prone.
Even a mere blind respect for rank or
title exalts the mind immeasurably as
compared with mammon-worship.</p>

<p>While on the subject of our leisure-class,
which is pretty nearly synonymous
with the landed gentry, we must
not pass over in silence a subject in
connexion with which the outcry
against "the drones of the hive" is
frequently introduced. We refer to
the Game-Laws. The whole question
of these laws has been so fully discussed
in a recent Number of this magazine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that we will not attempt in any
way to open that controversy. But
they are so commonly coupled with
the Laws of Entail as "feudalities,"
and as interfering with the transmission
of land according to "commercial
principles," that we could not altogether
omit the mention of them. We
will at this time only observe, that the
denunciation of the Game-Laws is a
part of the crusade which Hard-Cash,
that arrogant monopolist who bears no
brother near his throne, is waging
against all other objects of interest or
devotion. Let it not be supposed that
laws are of minor importance because
they relate to the amusements of any
portion of the community. They may
derive their importance from that circumstance
as tending to raise up something
which shall cope with the lust of
gold. The game-preserving interest
is worth maintenance if only as clashing
with mammonism.</p>

<p>While the brawlers about "improvement"
and "progress," are heaping their
meaningless abuse upon feudalities,
we should be glad to know what they
purpose to do with that greatest feudality
of all, the Crown? Already
there are symptoms of an intention to
take that matter in hand. Mr Cobden
and some of his Calibans have talked
in the House of Commons about curtailing
the "barbarous splendour" of
the throne. They know nothing and
care nothing about the historical association
and constitutional truths embodied
in the ancient appendages of
royalty. How should they? They want
somebody to look after the police, and
take care that no one robs their till;
that is their idea of government. They
want a man (some of them being
willing to allow him a small salary,
though others think that it does not
pay) to preach to the masses, and tell
them not to steal, and to be content
with their wages; that is their idea of
the church. We do not think, however,
that the tone of thought prevalent
among the Manchester school is
destined yet to lead the mind of England.
And we are the less inclined to
look forward to such a national debasement
when we find so enlightened an
advocate of free-trade policy as Mr
M'Culloch&mdash;the advocate of a theory
which we hold to be erroneous, but not
the selfish and greedy clamourer for
the gain of himself and his class&mdash;thus
coming forward to vindicate the laws
which preserve the hereditary character
of our aristocracy, which lend so
efficient an aid in shielding us from
the crushing tread of mammonism,
and in preventing "commercial principles"
from introducing the ledger
and day-book into our manor houses,
and the counter into our farmers'
parlours. In this view we most heartily
thank our author for his noble and
energetic contribution to our National
Defences at the present time; and as
there is a wide field open in connexion
with the subject he has so
powerfully handled, we cannot take
leave of him without expressing a
hope that we may before long listen
to him again "on the same side."</p>

<h2>LIFE IN THE "FAR WEST."</h2>

<h3>PART II.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">[The reader is informed that "Life in the Far West" is <em>no fiction</em>. The scenes and
incidents described are strictly true. The characters are real, (the names being
changed in two or three instances only,) and all have been, and are, well known
in the Western country.]</p></blockquote>


<p>"And Mary Brand herself,&mdash;what
is she like?"</p>

<p>"She's 'some' now; that <em>is</em> a fact,
and the biggest kind of punkin at
that," would have been the answer
from any man, woman, or child, in
Memphis County, and truly spoken
too; always understanding that the
pumpkin is <em>the</em> fruit to which the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne-plus-ultra</i> of female perfection is
compared by the figuratively speaking
westerns.</p>

<p>Being an American woman, of
course she was tall, and straight and
slim as a hickory sapling, well formed
withal, with rounded bust, and neck
white and slender as the swan's.
Her features were small, but finely
chiselled; and in this, it may be remarked,
the lower orders of the
American women differ from, and far
surpass the same class in England,
or elsewhere, where the features,
although far prettier, are more
vulgar and commonplace. She had
the bright blue eye, thin nose, and
small but sweetly-formed mouth,
the too fair complexion and dark
brown hair, which characterise the
beauty of the Anglo-American,
the heavy masses (hardly curls)
which fell over her face and neck
contrasting with their polished whiteness.
Such was Mary Brand: and to
her good looks being added a sweet
disposition, and all the good qualities
of a thrifty housewife, it must be allowed
that she fully justified the eulogiums
of the good people of Memphis.</p>

<p>Well, to cut a love-story short, in
the which not a little moral courage
is shown, young La Bonté fell desperately
in love with the pretty Mary,
and she with him; and small blame
to her, for he was a proper lad of
twenty&mdash;six feet in his moccassins&mdash;the
best hunter and rifle-shot in the
country, with many other advantages
too numerous to mention. But when
did the course, &amp;c. e'er run smooth?
When the affair had become a recognised
"courting," (and Americans
alone know the horrors of such prolonged
purgatory,) they became, to
use La Bonté's words, "awful fond,"
and consequently about once a-week
had their tiffs and makes-up.</p>

<p>However, on one occasion, at a
"husking," and during one of these
tiffs, Mary, every inch a woman, to
gratify some indescribable feeling,
brought to her aid jealousy&mdash;that old
serpent who has caused such mischief
in this world; and by a flirtation
over the corn-cobs with Big
Pete, La Bonté's former and only
rival, struck so hard a blow at the
latter's heart, that on the moment his
brain caught fire, blood danced before
his eyes, and he became like one
possessed. Pete observed and enjoyed
his struggling emotion&mdash;better
for him had he minded his corn-shelling
alone; and the more to annoy
his rival, paid the most sedulous attention
to the pretty Mary.</p>

<p>Young La Bonté stood it as long
as human nature, at boiling heat,
could endure; but when Pete, in the
exultation of his apparent triumph,
crowned his success by encircling the
slender waist of the girl with his arm,
and snatched a sudden kiss, he
jumped upright from his seat, and
seizing a small whisky-keg which
stood in the centre of the corn-shellers,
he hurled it at his rival, and
crying to him, hoarse with passion,
"to follow if he was a man," he left
the house.</p>

<p>At that time, and even now, in the
remoter states of the western country,
rifles settled even the most trivial
differences between the hot-blooded
youths; and of such frequent occurrence
and invariably bloody termination
did they become, that they
scarcely produced sufficient excitement
to draw together half a dozen spectators
of the duel.</p>

<p>In the present case, however, so
public was the quarrel, and so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
known the parties concerned, that
not only the people who had witnessed
the affair, but all the neighbourhood
thronged to the scene of action, where,
in a large field in front of the house,
the preliminaries of a duel between
Pete and La Bonté were being arranged
by their respective friends.</p>

<p>Mary, when she discovered the
mischief her thoughtlessness was
likely to occasion, was almost beside
herself with grief, but she knew how
vain it would be to attempt to interfere.
The poor girl, who was most
ardently attached to La Bonté, was
carried, swooning, into the house,
where all the women congregated,
and were locked in by old Brand,
who, himself an old pioneer, thought
but little of bloodshed, but refused to
let the "women folk" witness the affray.</p>

<p>Preliminaries arranged, the combatants
took up their respective positions
at either end of a space marked
for the purpose, at forty paces from
each other. They were both armed
with heavy rifles, and had the usual
hunting-pouches, containing ammunition,
hanging over the shoulder.
Standing with the butts of their rifles
on the ground, they confronted each
other, and the crowd drawing away a
few paces only on each side, left one
man to give the word. This was the
single word "fire;" and after this
signal was given, the combatants were
at liberty to fire away until one or the
other dropped.</p>

<p>At the word both the men quickly
raised their rifles to the shoulder, and
as the sharp cracks rung instantaneously,
they were seen to flinch, as
either felt the pinging sensation of a
bullet entering his flesh. Regarding
each other steadily for a few moments,
the blood running down La Bonté's
neck from a wound under the left jaw,
whilst his opponent was seen to place
his hand once to his right breast, as if
to feel the position of his wound, they
commenced reloading their rifles. As,
however, Pete was in the act of forcing
down the ball with his long hickory
wiping-stick, he suddenly dropped his
right arm,&mdash;the rifle slipped from his
grasp,&mdash;and, reeling for a moment like
a drunken man,&mdash;he fell dead to the
ground.</p>

<p>Even here, however, there was law
of some kind or another, and the consequences
of the duel were, that the
constables were soon on the trail of
La Bonté to arrest him. He, however,
easily avoided them, and taking
to the woods, lived for several days in
as wild a state as the beasts he hunted
and killed for his support.</p>

<p>Tired of this, however, he resolved
to quit the country, and betake himself
to the mountains, for which life he
had ever felt an inclination.</p>

<p>When, therefore, he thought the
officers of justice had tired of seeking
him, and the coast was comparatively
clear, he determined to start on his
distant expedition to the Far West.</p>

<p>Once more, before he carried his
project into execution, he sought and
had a last interview with Mary Brand.</p>

<p>"Mary," said he, "I'm about to
break. They're hunting me like a fall
buck, and I'm bound to quit. Don't
think any more about me, for I shall
never come back." Poor Mary burst
into tears, and bent her head on the
table near which she was sitting.
When again she raised it, she saw La
Bonté, with his long rifle on his shoulder,
striding with rapid steps from the
house; and year after year rolled on,
and he never returned.</p>

<p>A few days after this he found himself
at St Louis, the emporium of the
fur trade, and the fast rising metropolis
of the precocious settlements of
the west. Here, a prey to the agony
of mind which jealousy, remorse, and
blighted love mix into a very puchero
of misery, La Bonté got into the company
of certain "rowdies," a class
which every western city particularly
abounds in; and anxious to drown
his sorrows in any way, and quite
unscrupulous as to the means, he
plunged into all the vicious excitements
of drinking, gambling, and fighting,
which form the every-day amusements
of the rising generation of St
Louis.</p>

<p>Perhaps in no other part of the
United States, where indeed humanity
is frequently to be seen in many curious
and unusual phases, is there a population
so marked in its general character,
and at the same time divided into such
distinct classes, as in the above-named
city. Dating, as it does, its foundation
from yesterday,&mdash;for what are thirty
years in the growth of a metropolis?&mdash;its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
founders are now scarcely passed
middle life, regarding with astonishment
the growing works of their hands;
and whilst gazing upon its busy quays,
piled with grain and other produce of
the west, its fleets of huge steamboats
lying tier upon tier alongside the
wharves, its well-stored warehouses
and all the bustling concomitants of
a great commercial depot, they can
scarcely realise the memory of a few
short years, when on the same spot
nothing was to be seen but the few
miserable hovels of a French village&mdash;the
only sign of commerce the unwieldy
bateaux of the Indian traders,
laden with peltries from the distant
regions of the Platte and Upper Missouri.
Where now intelligent and
wealthy merchants walk erect, in conscious
substantiality of purse and
credit, and direct the commerce of a
vast and numerously-populated region,
but the other day stalked, in dress of
buckskin, the Indian trader of the
west; and all the evidences of life,
mayhap, consisted of the eccentric
vagaries of the different bands of
trappers and hardy mountaineers, who
accompanied, some for pleasure and
some as escort, the periodically arriving
bateaux, laden with the beaver
skins and buffalo robes collected during
the season at the different trading
posts in the Far West.</p>

<p>These, nevertheless, were the men
whose hardy enterprise opened to commerce
and the plough the vast and fertile
regions of the West. Rough and
savage though they were, they alone
were the pioneers of that extraordinary
tide of civilisation which has
poured its resistless current through
tracts large enough for kings to
govern; over a country now teeming
with cultivation, where, a few short
years ago, countless herds of buffalo
roamed unmolested, the bear and
deer abounded, and where the savage
Indian skulked through the woods
and prairies, lord of the unappreciated
soil which now yields its prolific
treasures to the spade and plough of
civilised man. To the wild and half-savage
trapper, who may be said to
exhibit the energy, enterprise, and
hardihood characteristic of the American
people, divested of all the false
and vicious glare with which a high
state of civilisation, too rapidly attained,
has obscured their real and
genuine character, in which the above
traits are eminently prominent&mdash;to
these men alone is due the empire
of the West&mdash;destined in a few short
years to become the most important
of those confederate states which compose
the mighty union of North
America.</p>

<p>Sprung, then, out of the wild and
adventurous fur trade, St Louis, still
the emporium of that species of commerce,
preserves even now, in the
character of its population, many of
the marked peculiarities which distinguished
its early founders, who were
identified with the primitive Indian
in hardiness and instinctive wisdom.
Whilst the French portion of the population
retain the thoughtless levity
and frivolous disposition of their original
source, the Americans of St
Louis, who may lay claim to be native,
as it were, are as particularly distinguished
for determination and energy
of character as they are for physical
strength and animal courage; and
are remarkable, at the same time, for
a singular aptitude in carrying out
commercial enterprises to successful
terminations, which would appear to
be incompatible with the love of adventure
and excitement which forms
so prominent a feature in their character.
In St Louis, nevertheless,
and from her merchants, have emanated
many commercial enterprises of
gigantic speculation, not confined to
its own locality or the distant Indian
fur trade, but embracing all parts of
the continent, and even a portion of
the Old World. And here it must be
remembered that St Louis is situated
inland, at a distance of upwards
of one thousand miles from the sea,
and three thousand from the capital of
the United States.</p>

<p>Besides her merchants and upper
class, who form a little aristocracy
even here, she has a large portion of
her population still connected with the
Indian and fur trade, who preserve all
their characteristics unacted upon by
the influence of advancing civilisation,
and between whom and other classes
there is a marked distinction. There is,
moreover, a large floating population
of foreigners of all nations, who must
possess no little amount of enterprise
to be tempted to this spot, from
whence they spread over the remote
western tracts, still invested by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
savage; and, therefore, if any of their
blood is infused into the native population,
the characteristic energy and
enterprise is increased, and not tempered
down, by the foreign cross.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most singular of her
casual population are the mountaineers,
who, after several seasons spent in
trapping, and with good store of
dollars, arrive from the scene of their
adventures, wild as savages, determined
to enjoy themselves, for a time,
in all the gaiety and dissipation of the
western city. In one of the back
streets of the town is a tavern well
known as the "Rocky Mountain
House," and here the trappers resort,
drinking and fighting as long as their
money lasts, which, as they are generous
and lavish as Jack Tars, is for
a few days only. Such scenes as are
enacted in the Rocky Mountain House,
both tragical and comical, are beyond
the powers of pen to describe;
and when a fandango is in progress,
to which congregate the coquettish
belles from "Vide Poche," as the
French portion of a suburb is nicknamed,&mdash;the
grotesque endeavours of
the bear-like mountaineers to sport a
figure on the light fantastic toe, and
their insertions into the dance of the
mystic jumps of Terpsichorean Indians
when engaged in the "medicine"
dances in honour of bear, of buffalo,
or ravished scalp,&mdash;are such startling
innovations on the choreographic art
as would cause the shade of Gallini to
quake and gibber in his pumps.</p>

<p>Passing the open doors and windows
of the Mountain House, the
stranger stops short as the sounds of
violin and banjo twang upon his ears,
accompanied by extraordinary noises&mdash;which
sound unearthly to the greenhorn
listener, but which the initiated
recognise as an Indian song roared
out of the stentorian lungs, of a mountaineer,
who, patting his stomach with
open hands, to improve the necessary
shake, choruses the well-known Indian
chant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hi&mdash;Hi&mdash;Hi&mdash;Hi,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hi-i&mdash;Hi-i&mdash;Hi-i&mdash;Hi-i<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="noind">and polishing off the high notes with
a whoop which makes the old wooden
houses shake again, as it rattles and
echoes down the street.</p>

<p>Here, over fiery "monaghahela,"
Jean Batiste, the sallow half-breed
voyageur from the north&mdash;and who,
deserting the service of the "North-West,"
(the Hudson's Bay Company,)
has come down the Mississippi,
from the "Falls," to try the sweets
and liberty of "free" trapping&mdash;hobnobs
with a stalwart leather-clad
"boy," just returned from trapping on
the waters of Grand River, on the
western side the mountains, who interlards
his mountain jargon with
Spanish words picked up in Taos
and California. In one corner a
trapper, lean and gaunt from the starving
regions of the Yellow Stone, has
just recognised an old companyero,
with whom he hunted years before in
the perilous country of the Blackfeet.</p>

<p>"Why, John, old hos, how do you
come on?"</p>

<p>"What! Meek, old 'coon! I thought
you were under?"</p>

<p>One from Arkansa stalks into the
centre of the room, with a pack of
cards in his hand, and a handful of
dollars in his hat. Squatting cross-legged
on a buffalo robe, he smacks
down the money, and cries out&mdash;"Ho,
boys, hyar's a deck, and hyar's
the beaver, (rattling the coin,) who
dar set his hos? Wagh!"</p>

<p>Tough are the yarns of wondrous
hunts and Indian perils, of hairbreadth
'scapes and curious "fixes." Transcendant
are the qualities of sundry rifles,
which call these hunters masters;
"plum" is the "centre" each vaunted
barrel shoots; sufficing for a hundred
wigs is the "hair" each hunter has
"lifted" from Indians' scalps; multitudinous
the "coups" he has "struck."
As they drink so do they brag, first of
their guns, their horses, and their
squaws, and lastly of themselves:&mdash;and
when it comes to that, "ware steel."</p>

<p>La Bonté, on his arrival at St.
Louis, found himself one day in no
less a place than this; and here he
made acquaintance with an old trapper
about to start for the mountains
in a few days, to hunt on the head
waters of Platte and Green River.
With this man he resolved to start,
and, having still some hundred dollars
in cash, he immediately set about
equipping himself for the expedition.
To effect this, he first of all visited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
gun-store of Hawken, whose rifles are
renowned in the mountains, and exchanged
his own piece, which was of
very small bore, for a regular mountain
rifle. This was of very heavy
metal, carrying about thirty-two balls
to the pound, stocked to the muzzle
and mounted with brass, its only ornament
being a buffalo bull, looking exceedingly
ferocious, which was not
very artistically engraved upon the
trap in the stock. Here, too, he laid in
a few pounds of powder and lead, and
all the necessaries for a long hunt.</p>

<p>His next visit was to a smith's store,
which smith was black by trade and
black by nature, for he was a nigger,
and, moreover, celebrated as being the
best maker of beaver-traps in St
Louis, and of whom he purchased six
new traps, paying for the same twenty
dollars&mdash;procuring, at the same time,
an old trap-sack, made of stout buffalo
skin, in which to carry them.</p>

<p>We next find La Bonté and his
companion&mdash;one Luke, better known
as Grey-Eye, one of his eyes having
been "gouged" in a mountain fray&mdash;at
Independence, a little town situated
on the Missouri, several hundred miles
above St Louis, and within a short
distance of the Indian frontier.</p>

<p>Independence may be termed the
"prairie port" of the western country.
Here the caravans destined for Santa
Fé and the interior of Mexico, assemble
to complete their necessary equipment.
Mules and oxen are purchased,
teamsters hired, and all stores and
outfit laid in here for the long journey
over the wide expanse of prairie
ocean. Here, too, the Indian traders
and the Rocky Mountain trappers
rendezvous, collecting in sufficient
force to ensure their safe passage
through the Indian country. At the
seasons of departure and arrival of
these bands, the little town presents
a lively scene of bustle and confusion.
The wild and dissipated mountaineers
get rid of their last dollars in furious
orgies, treating all comers to galore
of drink, and pledging each other, in
horns of potent whisky, to successful
hunts and "heaps of beaver."
When every cent has disappeared
from their pouches, the free trapper
often makes away with rifle, traps,
and animals, to gratify his "dry," (for
your mountaineer is never "thirsty;")
and then, "hos and beaver" gone, is
necessitated to hire himself to one of
the leaders of big bands, and hypothecate
his services for an equipment of
traps and animals. Thus La Bonté
picked up three excellent mules for a
mere song, with their accompanying
pack saddles, <i>apishamores</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and lariats,
and the next day, with Luke,
"put out" for Platte.</p>

<p>As they passed through the rendezvous,
which was encamped on a little
stream beyond the town, even our
young Mississippian was struck with
the novelty of the scene. Upwards
of forty huge waggons, of Connestoga
and Pittsburg build, and covered with
snow-white tilts, were ranged in a
semicircle, or rather a horse-shoe
form, on the flat open prairie, their
long "tongues" (poles) pointing outwards;
with the necessary harness for
four pairs of mules, or eight yoke of
oxen, lying on the ground beside
them, spread in ready order for "hitching
up." Round the waggons groups
of teamsters, tall stalwart young Missourians,
were engaged in busy preparation
for the start, greasing the
wheels, fitting or repairing harness,
smoothing ox-bows, or overhauling
their own moderate kits or "possibles."
They were all dressed in the
same fashion: a pair of "homespun"
pantaloons, tucked into thick boots
reaching nearly to the knee, and confined
round the waist by a broad
leathern belt, which supported a strong
butcher knife in a sheath. A coarse
checked shirt was their only other
covering, with a fur cap on the head.</p>

<p>Numerous camp-fires surrounded
the waggons, and by them lounged
wild-looking mountaineers, easily distinguished
from the "greenhorn"
teamsters by their dresses of buckskin,
and their weather-beaten faces. Without
an exception, these were under
the influence of the rosy god; and one,
who sat, the picture of misery, at a
fire by himself&mdash;staring into the blaze
with vacant countenance, his long
matted hair hanging in unkempt
masses over his face, begrimed with
the dirt of a week, and pallid with the
effects of ardent drink&mdash;was suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
from the usual consequences of having
"kept it up" beyond the usual point,
and now was paying the penalty in a
fit of "horrors"&mdash;as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delirium tremens</i>
is most aptly termed by sailors and
the unprofessional.</p>

<p>In another part, the merchants of
the caravan and Indian traders were
superintending the lading of the waggons,
or mule packs. These were
dressed in civilised attire, and some
bedizened in St Louis or Eastern
City dandyism, to the infinite disgust
of the mountain men, who look upon
a bourge-way (bourgeois) with most
undisguised contempt, despising the
very simplest forms of civilisation.
The picturesque appearance of the
encampment was not a little heightened
by the addition of several Indians
from the neighbouring Shawnee settlement,
who, mounted on their small
active horses, on which they reclined,
rather than sat, in negligent attitudes,
quietly looked on at the novel scene,
indifferent to the "chaff" which the
thoughtless teamsters indulged in at
their expense. Numbers of mules
and horses were picketed at hand,
while a large herd of noble oxen were
being driven towards the camp&mdash;the
wo-ha of the teamsters sounding far
and near, as they collected the scattered
beasts in order to yoke up.</p>

<p>As most of the mountain men were
utterly unable to move from camp,
Luke and La Bonté, with three or
four of the most sober, started in
company, intending to wait on "Blue,"
a stream which runs into the Caw or
Kanzas River, until the "balance" of
the band came up. Mounting their
mules, and leading the loose animals,
they struck at once into the park-like
prairie, and were out of sight of civilisation
in an instant.</p>

<p>It was the latter end of May, towards
the close of the season of
heavy rains, which in early spring
render the climate of this country
almost intolerable, at the same time
that they serve to fertilise and thaw
the soil, so long bound up by the
winter's frosts. The grass was every
where luxuriously green, and gaudy
flowers dotted the surface of the
prairie. This term, however, should
hardly be applied to the beautiful
undulating scenery of this park-like
country. Unlike the flat monotony
of the Grand Plains, here well wooded
uplands clothed with forest trees of
every species, and picturesque dells
through which run clear and bubbling
streams belted with gay-blossomed
shrubs, every where present themselves;
whilst on the level meadowland,
topes of trees with spreading
foliage afforded a shelter to the game
and cattle, and well-timbered knolls
rise at intervals from the plain.</p>

<p>Many clear streams dashing over
their pebbly beds intersect the country,
from which, in the noonday's
heat, the red-deer jump, shaking their
wet sides, as the noise of approaching
man disturbs them; and booming
grouse rise from the tall luxuriant
herbage at every step. Where the
deep escarpments of the river banks
exhibit the section of the earth, a
rich alluvial soil of surprising depth
appears to court the cultivation of
civilised man; and in every feature
it is evident that here nature has
worked with kindliest and most bountiful
hand.</p>

<p>For hundreds of miles along the
western or right bank of the Missouri
does such a country as this extend,
to which, for fertility and natural resources,
no part of Europe can offer even
feeble comparison. Sufficiently large
to contain an enormous population, it
has, besides, every advantage of position,
and all the natural capabilities
which should make it the happy
abode of civilised man. Through this
unpeopled country the United States
pours her greedy thousands, to seize
upon the barren territories of her
feeble neighbour.</p>

<p>Camping the first night on "Black
Jack," our mountaineers here cut each
man a spare hickory wiping-stick for
his rifle, and La Bonté, who was the
only greenhorn of the party, witnessed
a savage ebullition of rage on
the part of one of his companions,
exhibiting the perfect unrestraint
which these men impose upon their
passions, and the barbarous anger
which the slightest opposition to the
will excites. One of the trappers, on
arriving at the camping-place, dismounted
from his horse, and, after
divesting it of the saddle, endeavoured
to lead his mule by the rope up to
the spot where he wished to deposit his
pack. Mule-like, however, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
he pulled the more stubbornly she
remained in her tracks, planting her
fore-legs firmly, and stretching out
her neck with provoking obstinacy.
If truth be told, it does require the
temper of a thousand Jobs to manage
a mule; and in no case does the wilful
mulishness of the animal stir up
one's choler more than in the very
trick which this one was playing, and
which is a daily occurrence. After
tugging ineffectually for several
minutes, winding the rope round his
body, and throwing himself forward
and suddenly with all his strength,
the trapper actually foamed with
passion; and although he might have
subdued the animal at once by fastening
the rope with a half-hitch round
its nose, with an obstinacy equal to
that of the mule itself he refused to
attempt it, preferring to vanquish her
by main strength. However, this
failed, and with a volley of blasphemous
imprecations the mountaineer
suddenly seized his rifle, and, levelling
it at the mule's head, shot her dead.</p>

<p>Passing the Wa-ka-rasha, a well-timbered
stream, they met a band of
Osages going "to buffalo." These
Indians, in common with some tribes
of the Pawnees, shave the head, with
the exception of a ridge from the
forehead to the centre of the scalp,
which is "roached" or hogged like the
mane of a mule, and stands erect,
plastered with unguents, and ornamented
by feathers of the hawk and
turkey. The naked scalp is often
painted in mosaic with black and red,
the face with shining vermilion.
They were all naked to the breech-clout,
the warmth of the sun having
caused them to throw their dirty
blankets from their shoulders. These
Indians not unfrequently levy contributions
on strangers whom they may
accidentally meet; but they easily
distinguish the determined mountaineer
from the incautious greenhorn,
and think it better to let the former
alone.</p>

<p>Crossing Vermilion, they arrived
on the fifth day at "Blue," where they
encamped in the broad timber which
belts the creek, and there awaited the
arrival of the remainder of the party.</p>

<p>It was two days before they came
up; but the day after, fourteen in
number, they started for the mountains,
striking a trail which follows
the "Big Blue" in its course through
the prairies, which, as they advance to
the westward, are gradually smoothing
away into a vast unbroken expanse
of rolling plain. Herds of antelope
began to show themselves, and some
of the hunters, leaving the trail, soon
returned with plenty of their tender
meat. The luxuriant but coarse grass
they had hitherto seen now changed
into the nutritious and curly buffalo
grass, and their animals soon improved
in appearance on the excellent
pasture. In a few days, without
any adventure, they struck the Platte
River, its shallow waters (from which
it derives its name) spreading over a
wide and sandy bed, numerous sand
bars obstructing the sluggish current,
and with nowhere sufficient water to
wet the forder's knee.</p>

<p>By this time, but few antelope
having been seen, the party became
entirely out of meat; and, one whole
day and part of another having passed
without so much as a sage rabbit
having presented itself, not a few
objurgations on the buffalo grumbled
from the lips of the hunters, who
expected ere this to have reached
the land of plenty. La Bonté killed
a fine deer, however, in the river
bottom, after they had encamped,
not one particle of which remained
after supper that night, but which
hardly took the rough edge off their
keen appetites. Although already in
the buffalo range, no traces of these
animals had yet been seen; and as
the country afforded but little game,
and the party did not care to halt and
lose time in hunting for it, they
moved along hungry and sulky, the
theme of conversation being the well
remembered merits of good buffalo
meat,&mdash;of "fat fleece," "hump rib,"
and "tender loin;" of delicious
"boudins," and marrow bones too
good to think of. La Bonté had
never seen the lordly animal, and
consequently but half believed the
accounts of the mountaineers, who
described their countless bands as
covering the prairie far as the eye
could reach, and requiring days of
travel to pass through; but the
visions of such dainty and abundant
feeding as they descanted on set his
mouth watering, and danced before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
his eyes as he slept supperless, night
after night, on the banks of the hungry
Platte.</p>

<p>One morning he had packed his
animals before the rest, and was
riding a mile in advance of the party,
when he saw on one side the trail,
looming in the refracted glare which
mirages the plains, three large dark
objects without shape or form, which
rose and fell in the exaggerated light
like ships at sea. Doubting what it
could be, he approached the strange
objects; and as the refraction disappeared
before him, the dark masses
assumed a more distinct form, and
clearly moved with life. A little
nearer, and he made them out&mdash;they
were buffalo. Thinking to distinguish
himself, the greenhorn dismounted
from his mule, and quickly hobbled
her, throwing his lasso on the ground
to trail behind when he wished to
catch her. Then, rifle in hand, he
approached the huge animals, and,
being a good hunter, knew well to
take advantage of the inequalities of
the ground and face the wind; by
which means he crawled at length to
within forty yards of the buffalo, who
were quietly cropping the grass, unconscious
of danger. Now, for the
first time, he gazed upon the noble
beast of which he had so often heard,
and longed to see. With coal-black
beard sweeping the ground as he fed,
an enormous bull was in advance of
the others, his wild brilliant eyes
peering from an immense mass of
shaggy hair, which covered his neck
and shoulder. From this point his
skin was bare as one's hand, a sleek
and shining dun, and his ribs well
covered with shaking flesh. As he
leisurely cropped the short curly
grass he occasionally lifted his tail
into the air, and stamped his foot as
a fly or musquito annoyed him&mdash;flapping
the intruder with his tail, or
snatching at the itching part with his
ponderous head.</p>

<p>When La Bonté had sufficiently
admired the animal, he lifted his rifle,
and, taking steady aim, and certain of
his mark, pulled the trigger, expecting
to see the huge beast fall over at the
report. What was his surprise and
consternation, however, to see the
animal flinch as the ball struck him,
but gallop off, followed by the others,
and apparently unhurt. As is generally
the case with greenhorns, he
had fired too high, not understanding
that the only certain spot to strike a
buffalo is but a few inches above the
brisket, and that above this a shot is
rarely fatal. When he rose from the
ground, he saw all the party halting
in full view of his discomfiture; and
when he joined them, loud were the
laughs, and deep the regrets of the
hungry at his first attempt.</p>

<p>However, they now knew that they
were in the country of meat; and a
few miles farther, another band of
stragglers presenting themselves,
three of the hunters went in pursuit,
La Bonté taking a mule to pack in
the meat. He soon saw them crawling
towards the band, and shortly
two puffs of smoke, and the sharp
cracks of their rifles showed that
they had got within shot; and when
he had ridden up, two fine buffaloes
were stretched upon the ground.
Now, for the first time, he was initiated
into the mysteries of "butchering,"
and watched the hunters as
they turned the carcass on the belly,
stretching out the legs to support it
on each side. A transverse cut was
then made at the nape of the neck,
and, gathering the long hair of the
boss in one hand, the skin was separated
from the shoulder. It was then
laid open from this point to the tail,
along the spine, and the skin was
freed from the sides and pulled down
to the brisket, but, still attached to
it, was stretched upon the ground to
receive the dissected portions. Then
the shoulder was severed, the fleece
removed from along the backbone,
and the hump-ribs cut off with a
tomahawk. All this was placed upon
the skin; and after the "boudins" had
been withdrawn from the stomach,
and the tongue&mdash;a great dainty&mdash;taken
from the head, the meat was
packed upon the mule, and the whole
party hurried to camp rejoicing.</p>

<p>There was merry-making in the
camp that night, and the way they
indulged their appetites&mdash;or, in their
own language, "throw'd" the meat
"cold"&mdash;would have made the heart
of a dyspeptic leap for joy or burst
with envy. Far into the "still
watches of the tranquil night" the
fat-clad "depouille" saw its fleshy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
mass grow small by degrees and beautifully
less, before the trenchant blades
of the hungry mountaineers; appetising
yards of well-browned "boudin"
slipped glibly down their throats; rib
after rib of tender hump was picked
and flung to the wolves; and when
human nature, with helpless gratitude,
and confident that nothing of
superexcellent comestibility remained,
was lazily wiping the greasy
knife that had done such good service,&mdash;a
skilful hunter was seen to chuckle
to himself as he raked the deep ashes
of the fire, and drew therefrom a pair
of tongues so admirably baked, so
soft, so sweet, and of such exquisite
flavour, that a veil is considerately
drawn over the effects their discussion
produced in the mind of our greenhorn
La Bonté, and the raptures they
excited in the bosom of that, as yet,
most ignorant mountaineer. Still,
as he ate he wondered, and wondering
admired, that nature, in giving him
such profound gastronomic powers,
and such transcendent capabilities of
digestion, had yet bountifully provided
an edible so peculiarly adapted
to his ostrich-like appetite, that after
consuming nearly his own weight in
rich and fat buffalo meat, he felt as
easy and as incommoded as if he had
been lightly supping on strawberries
and cream.</p>

<p>Sweet was the digestive pipe after
such a feast, and soft the sleep and
deep, which sealed the eyes of the
contented trappers that night. It felt
like the old thing, they said, to be
once more amongst the "meat;" and,
as they were drawing near the dangerous
portion of the trail, they felt at
home; although not a night now
passed but, when they lay down on
their buffalo robes to sleep, they could
not be confident that that sleep was
not their last&mdash;knowing full well that
savage men were hovering near, thirsting
for their lives.</p>

<p>However, no enemies showed themselves
as yet, and they proceeded
quietly up the river, vast herds of
buffaloes darkening the plains around
them, affording them more than abundance
of the choicest meat; but, to
their credit be it spoken, no more was
killed than absolutely required,&mdash;unlike
the cruel slaughter made by most
of the white travellers across the
plains, who wantonly destroy these
noble animals, not even for the excitement
of sport, but in cold-blooded
and insane butchery. La Bonté had
practice enough to perfect him in the
art, and, before the buffalo range was
passed, he was ranked as a first-rate
hunter. One evening he had left the
camp for meat, and was approaching
a band of cows for that purpose,
crawling towards them along the bed
of a dry hollow in the prairie, when
he observed them suddenly jump away
towards him, and immediately after a
score of mounted Indians appeared in
sight, whom, by their dress, he at
once knew to be Pawnees and enemies.
Thinking they might not discover
him, he crouched down in the
ravine; but a noise behind causing
him to turn his head, he saw some
five or six advancing up the bed of
the dry creek, whilst several more
were riding on the bluffs. The cunning
savages had cut off his retreat to
his mule, which he saw in the possession
of one of the Indians. His
presence of mind, however, did not
desert him; and seeing at once that
to remain where he was would be like
being caught in a trap, (as the Indians
could advance to the edge of the bluff
and shoot him from above,) he made
for the open prairie, determined at
least to sell his scalp dearly, and make
"a good fight." With a yell the
Indians charged, but halted when
they saw the sturdy trapper deliberately
kneel, and, resting his rifle
on the wiping-stick, take a steady
aim as they advanced. Full well the
Pawnees know, to their cost, that a
mountaineer seldom pulls his trigger
without sending a bullet to the mark;
and, certain that one at least must
fall, they hesitated to make the onslaught.
Steadily the white retreated
with his face to the foe, bringing the
rifle to his shoulder the instant that
one advanced within shot, the Indians
galloping round, firing the few guns
they had amongst them at long distances,
but without effect. One young
"brave," more daring than the rest,
rode out of the crowd, and dashed at
the hunter, throwing himself, as he
passed within a few yards, from the
saddle, and hanging over the opposite
side of his horse,&mdash;presenting no
other mark than his left foot,&mdash;discharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
his bow from under the animal's
neck, and with such good aim,
that the arrow, whizzing through the
air, struck the stock of La Bonté's
rifle, which was at his shoulder, and,
glancing off, pierced his arm, inflicting,
luckily, but a slight wound. Again
the Indian turned in his course, the
others encouraging him with loud
war-whoops, and once more passing
at still less distance, drew his arrow
to the head. This time, however,
the eagle eye of the white caught sight
of the action, and suddenly rising from
his knee as the Indian was approaching,
hanging by his foot alone over
the opposite side of the horse, he
jumped towards the animal with outstretched
arms and a loud yell, causing
it to start so suddenly, and swerve
from its course, that the Indian lost
his foot-hold, and, after in vain struggling
to regain his position, fell to the
ground, but instantly rose upon his
feet and gallantly confronted the
mountaineer, striking his hand upon
his brawny chest and shouting a loud
whoop of defiance. In another instant
the rifle of La Bonté had poured
forth its contents; and the brave
Indian, springing into the air, fell
dead to the ground, just as the other
trappers, who had heard the firing,
galloped up to the spot, at sight
of whom the Pawnees, with yells
of disappointed vengeance, hastily
retreated.</p>

<p>That night La Bonté first lifted
hair!</p>

<p>A few days after they reached the
point where the Platte divides into
two great forks:&mdash;the northern one,
stretching to the north-west, skirts
the eastern base of the Black Hills,
and sweeping round to the south rises
in the vicinity of the mountain valley
called the New Park, receiving the
Laramie, Medicine Bow, and Sweet-Water
creeks. The other, or "South
Fork," strikes towards the mountains
in a south-westerly direction, hugging
the base of the main chain of the
Rocky Mountains, and, fed by several
small creeks, rises in the uplands of
the Bayou Salado, near which is also
the source of the Arkansa. To the
forks of the Platte the valley of that
river extends from three to five miles
on each side, being enclosed by steep
sandy bluffs, from the summits of
which the prairies stretch away in
broad undulating expanse to the north
and south. The "bottom," as it is
termed, is but thinly covered with
timber, the cotton-woods being scattered
only here and there; but some
of the islands in the broad bed of the
stream are well wooded, which leads
to the inference that the trees on the
banks have been felled by Indians who
formerly frequented this river as a
chosen hunting-ground. As during
the long winters the pasture in the
vicinity is scarce and withered, the
Indians feed their horses on the bark
of the sweet cotton-wood, upon which
they subsist, and even fatten. Thus,
wherever a village has been encamped,
the trunks of these trees strew the
ground, with their upper limbs and
smaller branches peeled of their bark,
and looking as white and smooth as if
scraped with a knife.</p>

<p>On the forks, however, the timber
is heavier and of greater variety, some
of the creeks being well wooded with
ash and cherry, which break the monotony
of the everlasting cotton-wood.</p>

<p>Dense masses of buffalo still continued
to darken the plains, and
numerous bands of wolves hovered
round the outskirts of the vast herds,
singling out the sick and wounded
animals, and preying upon the calves
whom the rifles and arrows of the
hunters had bereaved of their mothers.
The white wolf is the invariable attendant
upon the buffalo; and when one
of these persevering animals is seen, it
is certain sign that buffalo are not
far distant. Besides the buffalo wolf,
there are four distinct varieties common
to the plains, and all more or less
attendant upon the buffalo. These
are the black, the gray, the brown,
and last and least the <em>coyote</em>, or
<i>cayeute</i> of the mountaineers, the
"<i>wach-unkamănet</i>," or "medicine
wolf" of the Indians, who hold the
latter animal in reverential awe. This
little wolf, whose fur is of great thickness
and beauty, although of diminutive
size, is wonderfully sagacious, and
makes up by cunning what it wants
in physical strength. In bands of
from three to thirty they will not unfrequently
station themselves along
the "runs" of the deer and the antelope,
extending their line for many
miles,&mdash;and the quarry being started,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
each wolf will follow in pursuit until
tired, when it relinquishes the chase to
another relay, following slowly after
until the animal is fairly run down,
when all hurry to the spot and speedily
consume the carcass. The cayeute,
however, is often made a tool of by
his larger brethren, unless, indeed, he
acts from motives of spontaneous charity.
When a hunter has slaughtered
game, and is in the act of butchering
it, these little wolves sit patiently at
a short distance from the scene of
operations, while at a more respectful
one the larger wolves (the white or
gray) lope hungrily around, licking
their chops in hungry expectation.
Not unfrequently the hunter throws a
piece of meat towards the smaller
one, who seizes it immediately, and
runs off with the morsel in his mouth.
Before he gets many yards with his
prize, the large wolf pounces with a
growl upon him, and the cayeute,
dropping the meat, returns to his former
position, and will continue his
act as long as the hunter
pleases to supply him.</p>

<p>Wolves are so common on the
plains and in the mountains, that the
hunter never cares to throw away a
charge of ammunition upon them, although
the ravenous animals are a
constant source of annoyance to him,
creeping to the camp-fire at night,
and gnawing his saddles and <i>apishamores</i>,
eating the skin ropes which
secure the horses and mules to their
pickets, and even their very hobbles,
and not unfrequently killing or entirely
disabling the animals themselves.</p>

<p>Round the camp, during the night,
the cayeute keeps unremitting watch,
and the traveller not unfrequently
starts from his bed with affright, as
the mournful and unearthly chiding of
the wolf breaks suddenly upon his
ear: the long-drawn howl being taken
up by others of the band, until it dies
away in the distance, as some straggler
passing within hearing answers to the
note, and howls as he lopes away.</p>

<p>Our party crossed the south fork
about ten miles from its juncture with
the main stream, and then, passing the
prairie, struck the north fork a day's
travel from the other. At the mouth
of an ash-timbered creek they came
upon Indian "sign," and, as now they
were in the vicinity of the treacherous
Sioux, they moved along with additional
caution, Frapp and Gonneville,
two experienced mountaineers, always
heading the advance.</p>

<p>About noon they had crossed over
to the left bank of the fork, intending
to camp on a large creek where some
fresh beaver "sign" had attracted the
attention of some of the trappers; and
as, on further examination, it appeared
that two or three lodges of that animal
were not far distant, it was determined
to remain here a day or two,
and set their traps.</p>

<p>Gonneville, old Luke, and La Bonté,
had started up the creek, and were
carefully examining the banks for
"sign," when the former, who was in
front, suddenly paused, and looking
intently up the stream, held up his
hand to his companions to signal them
to stop.</p>

<p>Luke and La Bonté both followed
the direction of the trapper's intent
and fixed gaze. The former uttered
in a suppressed tone the expressive
exclamation, Wagh!&mdash;the latter saw
nothing but a wood-duck swimming
swiftly down the stream, followed by
her downy progeny.</p>

<p>Gonneville turned his head, and
extending his arm twice with a forward
motion up the creek, whispered&mdash;"Les
sauvages."</p>

<p>"Injuns, sure, and Sioux at that,"
answered Luke.</p>

<p>Still La Bonté looked, but nothing
met his view but the duck with her
brood, now rapidly approaching; and
as he gazed, the bird suddenly took
wing, and, flapping on the water,
flew a short distance down the stream
and once more settled on it.</p>

<p>"Injuns?" he asked; "where are
they?"</p>

<p>"Whar?" repeated old Luke,
striking the flint of his rifle, and opening
the pan to examine the priming.
"What brings a duck a-streakin it
down stream, if humans aint behint
her? and who's thar in these diggins
but Injuns, and the worst kind; and
we'd better push to camp, I'm thinking,
if we mean to save our hair."</p>

<p>"Sign" sufficient, indeed, it was to all
the trappers, who, on being apprised
of it, instantly drove in their animals,
and picketed them; and hardly had
they done so when a band of Indians
made their appearance on the banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of the creek, from whence they galloped
to the bluff which overlooked the
camp at the distance of about six
hundred yards; and crowning this, in
number some forty or more, commenced
brandishing their spears and
guns, and whooping loud yells of
defiance. The trappers had formed a
little breast-work of their packs, forming
a semicircle, the chord of which
was made by the animals standing in
a line, side by side, closely picketed
and hobbled. Behind this defence
stood the mountaineers, rifle in hand,
and silent and determined. The Indians
presently descended the bluff on
foot, leaving their animals in charge of
a few of the party, and, scattering,
advanced under cover of the sage
bushes which dotted the bottom, to
about two hundred yards of the whites.
Then a chief advanced before the rest,
and made the sign for a talk with
the Long-knives, which led to a consultation
amongst the latter, as to the
policy of acceding to it. They were
in doubts as to the nation these Indians
belonged to, some bands of the
Sioux being friendly, and others bitterly
hostile to the whites.</p>

<p>Gonneville, who spoke the Sioux
language, and was well acquainted
with the nation, affirmed they belonged
to a band called the Yanka-taus, well
known to be the most evil-disposed
of that treacherous nation; another
of the party maintaining that they
were Brulés, and that the chief advancing
towards them was the well-known
Tah-sha-tunga or Bull Tail, a
most friendly chief of that tribe. The
majority, however, trusted to Gonneville,
and he volunteered to go out to
meet the Indian, and hear what he
had to say. Divesting himself of all
arms save his butcher-knife, he advanced
towards the savage, who
awaited his approach, enveloped in
the folds of his blanket. At a glance
he knew him to be a Yanka-tau,
from the peculiar make of his moccassins,
and the way in which his face
was daubed with paint.</p>

<p>"Howgh!" exclaimed both as they
met; and, after a silence of a few moments,
the Indian spoke, asking&mdash;"Why
the Long-knives hid behind
their packs, when his band approached?
Were they afraid, or were they
preparing a dog-feast to entertain
their friends? That the whites were
passing through his country, burning
his wood, drinking his water, and killing
his game; but he knew that they
had now come to pay for the mischief
they had done, and that the mules and
horses they had brought with them
were intended as a present to their
red friends.</p>

<p>"He was Mah-to-ga-shane," he
said, "the Brave Bear: his tongue
was short, but his arm long; and he
loved rather to speak with his bow
and his lance, than with the weapon
of a squaw. He had said it: the Long-knives
had horses with them and
mules; and these were for him, he
knew, and for his 'braves.' Let the
White-face go back to his people and
return with the animals, or he, the
'Brave Bear,' would have to come
and take them; and his young men
would get mad and would feel blood
in their eyes; and then he would have
no power over them; and the whites
would have to 'go under.'"</p>

<p>The trapper answered shortly.&mdash;"The
Long-knives," he said, "had
brought the horses for themselves&mdash;their
hearts were big, but not towards
the Yanka-taus: and if they had to
give up their animals, it would be to
<em>men</em> and not <em>squaws</em>. They were not
'wah-keitcha,'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (French engagés) but
Long-knives; and, however short
were the tongues of the Yanka-taus,
theirs were still shorter, and their
rifles longer. The Yanka-taus were
dogs and squaws, and the Long-knives
spat upon them."</p>

<p>Saying this, the trapper turned his
back and rejoined his companions;
whilst the Indian slowly proceeded to
his people, who, on learning the contemptuous
way in which their threats
had been treated, testified their anger
with loud yells; and, seeking whatever
cover was afforded, commenced
a scattering volley upon the camp of
the mountaineers. The latter reserved
their fire, treating with cool
indifference the balls which began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
rattle about them; but as the Indians,
emboldened by this apparent inaction,
rushed for a closer position, and
exposed their bodies within a long
range, half-a-dozen rifles rang from
the assailed, and two Indians fell
dead, one or two more being wounded.
As yet, not one of the whites had
been touched, but several of the animals
had received wounds from the
enemy's fire of balls and arrows.
Indeed, the Indians remained at too
great a distance to render the volleys
from their crazy fusees any thing like
effectual, and had to raise their pieces
considerably to make their bullets
reach as far as the camp. After having
lost three of their band killed
outright, and many more being wounded,
their fire began to slacken, and
they drew off to a greater distance,
evidently resolved to beat a retreat;
and retiring to the bluff, discharged
their pieces in a last volley, mounted
their horses and galloped off, carrying
their wounded with them. This
last volley, however, although intended
as a mere bravado, unfortunately
proved fatal to one of the whites.
Gonneville, at the moment, was
standing on one of the packs, in order
to get an uninterrupted sight for a
last shot, when one of the random
bullets struck him in the breast. La
Bonté caught him in his arms as he
was about to fall, and, laying the
wounded trapper gently on the
ground,&mdash;they proceeded to strip him
of his buckskin hunting-frock, to examine
the wound. A glance was
sufficient to convince his companions
that the blow was mortal. The ball
had passed through the lungs; and in
a few moments the throat of the
wounded man began to swell, as the
choking blood ascended, and turned
a livid blue colour. But a few drops
of purple blood trickled from the
wound,&mdash;a fatal sign,&mdash;and the eyes of
the mountaineer were already glazing
with death's icy touch. His
hand still grasped the barrel of his
rifle, which had done good service in
the fray. Anon he essayed to speak,
but, choked with blood, only a few
inarticulate words reached the ears
of his companions, who were bending
over him.</p>

<p>"Rubbed&mdash;out&mdash;at&mdash;last," they
heard him say, the words gurgling in
his blood-filled throat; and opening
his eyes once more, and looking upwards
to take a last look at the bright
sun, the trapper turned gently on his
side and breathed his last sigh.</p>

<p>With no other tools than their
scalp-knives, the hunters dug a grave
on the banks of the creek; and whilst
some were engaged in this work,
others sought the bodies of the Indians
they had slain in the attack, and
presently returned with three reeking
scalps, the trophies of the fight. The
body of the mountaineer was then
wrapped in a buffalo robe, the scalps
being placed on the dead man's breast,
laid in the shallow grave, and
quickly covered&mdash;without a word of
prayer, or sigh of grief; for, however
much his companions may have felt,
not a word escaped them; although
the bitten lip and frowning brow told
tale of anger more than sorrow, and
vowed&mdash;what they thought would
better please the spirit of the dead
man than sorrow&mdash;lasting revenge.</p>

<p>Trampling down the earth which
filled the grave, they placed upon it
a pile of heavy stones; and packing
their mules once more, and taking a
last look of their comrade's lonely
resting-place, they turned their backs
upon the stream, which has ever since
been known as "Gonneville's Creek."</p>

<p>If the reader casts his eye over any
of the recent maps of the western
country, which detail the features of
the regions embracing the Rocky
Mountains, and the vast prairies at
their bases, he will not fail to observe
that many of the creeks or smaller
streams which feed the larger rivers,&mdash;as
the Missouri, Platte, and Arkansa&mdash;are
called by familiar proper
names, both English and French.
These are invariably christened after
some unfortunate trapper, killed there
in Indian fight; or treacherously
slaughtered by the lurking savages,
while engaged in trapping beaver on the
stream. Thus alone is the memory of
these hardy men perpetuated, at least
of those whose fate is ascertained:
for many, in every season, never
return from their hunting expeditions,
having met a sudden death
from Indians, or a more lingering fate
from accident or disease in some of
the lonely gorges of the mountains,
where no footfall save their own, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the heavy tread of grizzly bear, disturbs
the unbroken silence of these
awful solitudes. Then, as many winters
pass without some old familiar
faces making their appearance at the
merry rendezvous, their long protracted
absence may perhaps occasion
such remarks, as to where such and
such a mountain worthy can have
betaken himself, to which the casual
rejoinder of "Gone under, maybe,"
too often gives a short but certain
answer.</p>

<p>In all the philosophy of hardened
hearts, our hunters turned from the
spot where the unmourned trapper
met his death. La Bonté, however,
not yet entirely steeled by mountain
life to a perfect indifference to human
feeling, drew his hard hand across
his eye, as the unbidden tear rose
from his rough but kindly heart. He
could not forget so soon the comrade
they had lost, the companionship in
the hunt or over the cheerful camp-fire,
the narrator of many a tale of
dangers past, of sufferings from hunger,
cold, and thirst, and from untended
wounds, of Indian perils, and
of a life spent in such vicissitudes.
One tear dropped from the young
hunter's eye, and rolled down his
cheek&mdash;the last for many a long year.</p>

<p>In the forks of the northern branch
of the Platte, formed by the junction of
the Laramie, they found a big village
of the Sioux encamped near the station
of one of the fur companies.
Here the party broke up; many, finding
the alcohol of the traders an impediment
to their further progress, remained
some time in the vicinity,
while La Bonté, Luke, and a trapper
named Marcelline, started in a few
days to the mountains, to trap on
Sweet Water and Medicine Bow.
They had leisure, however, to observe
all the rascalities connected with the
Indian trade, although at this season
(August) hardly commenced. However,
a band of Indians having come
in with several packs of last year's
robes, and being anxious to start
speedily on their return, a trader
from one of the forts had erected his
lodge in the village.</p>

<p>Here, he set to work immediately
to induce the Indians to trade. First,
a chief appointed three "soldiers" to
guard the trader's lodge from intrusion;
and who, amongst the thieving
fraternity, can be invariably trusted.
Then the Indians were invited to
have a drink&mdash;a taste of the fire-water
being given to all to incite
them to trade. As the crowd presses
upon the entrance to the lodge, and
those in rear become impatient, some
large-mouthed possessor of many
friends, who has received a portion of
the spirit, makes his way, with his
mouth full of the liquor and cheeks
distended, through the throng, and
is instantly surrounded by his particular
friends. Drawing the face of
each, by turns, near his own, he
squirts a small quantity into his open
mouth, until the supply is exhausted,
when he returns for more, and repeats
the generous distribution.</p>

<p>When paying for the robes, the traders,
in measuring out the liquor in a
tin half-pint cup, thrust their thumbs
or the four fingers of the hand into the
measure, in order that it may contain
the less, or not unfrequently fill
the bottom with melted buffalo fat,
with the same object. So greedy are
the Indians, that they never discover
the cheat, and once under the influence
of the liquor, cannot distinguish
between the first cup of comparatively
strong spirit, and the following
ones diluted five hundred per cent,
and poisonously drugged to boot.</p>

<p>Scenes of drunkenness, riot, and
bloodshed last until the trade is over,
which in the winter occupies several
weeks, during which period the Indians
present the appearance, under
the demoralising influence of the
liquor, of demons rather than men.</p>

<h2>AMERICAN THOUGHTS ON EUROPEAN REVOLUTIONS.</h2>


<p class="sig">
<em>Boston, May 1848.</em>
</p>

<p>A thousand leagues of ocean, my
Basil, are indeed between us, but it
is no longer right to reckon distances
by leagues. Time is your only measure.
I know of a gentleman who had a
home in Paris, while Paris was capable
of homes, and he came every year
across the Atlantic, only to fish for
trout. Why do you stare? You
know very well that you have often
waited a fortnight for a good day to
go a-fishing. Come, then, pack up
your slender reed, and spend such a
fortnight in a steamer. By God's
favour you shall be the better for sea
air; and in two weeks from Liverpool,
you shall find yourself on the shores
of a lake in the interior of the State
of New York, where, since the fifth
day of the creation, the trout have
apparently been multiplying in a
manner that would astonish a Malthus.
Such is now that dissociable
ocean, which was once thought too
great a waste of waters to be passed
by colonial members of parliament
representing the provinces of America.
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Opposuit Natura</i>;" said Burke, "I
cannot remove the eternal barriers of
the creation." But Burke forgot his
Greek:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Πολλὰ τὰ δεινὰ, κοὐδεν ανθρώπου
δεινότερον πελει·τοῦτο καὶ πολιοῦ πέραν
πόντου χειμερίῳ νοτῳ χωρεί, περιβρυχίοισι
περῶν ἐρ' oἴδμασι·"</p></blockquote>

<p>I know it is an old saw, but it is so
freshened by the modern instance of
steamers every week, that it has become
quotable once more; and I have
almost a mind to go on with the
chorus, and show that Sophocles may
be fairly rendered in favour of railways
and iron-steeds. But the telegraph,
Basil! I must even quote a bit
of English for that. As gentle Cowper
saith:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The tempest itself lags behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the swift-wing'd arrows of light!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">The wires are already stretched from
Massachusetts, and almost from Halifax
to the Gulf of Mexico. A spark
here, and the lettered bulletin is reeling
off in Louisiana! The fresh news
will, hereafter, be hawked in the
streets of Boston and along the
wharves of New Orleans in the same
hour. It will soon be sent farther
still; and a British fleet in the Pacific
may be served with orders from
the Admiralty Board, not two weeks
old. We are fairly in hand-shaking
neighbourhood. I remember when
European intelligence came to us rather
as history than as news. It is
not so now. While emotion is yet
warm with you, it sets our own hearts
throbbing. We, too, are, in the present
tense, with Europe; for the revolutions
of peace have been more wonderful
than those of warfare. They
have reunited what strife had sundered,
and rendered England and America
again one family.</p>

<p>Talking of revolutions,&mdash;how hot
the noon of the century is growing!
You will allow, dear Basil, that we in
America, are well situated to be lookers
on. With all the security of distance,
we have the advantages of nearness.
You are on the stage&mdash;we are in the
boxes. You go behind the scenes, and
see the wire-working and machinery,
but we get the effect of the spectacle.
The great revolutionary drama is before
us, and we can behold it calmly;
interested, but not involved. For a
devout or philosophical spectator,
America is the true observatory.
Here we can watch "the great Babel,
and not feel the crowd." It is our
own fault if, with such advantages,
we do not anticipate the judgment of
future ages, and arrive instinctively
at conclusions which those who share
the tumult itself must ordinarily learn
in the soberness of after-thoughts, or,
perhaps, by a dear experience.</p>

<p>Did you ask how the doings in
France appear in republican eyes?
And pray what do you expect me to
answer? You appear to think republicanism
a specific instead of a generic
term, and to expect us to hail the
French as our kindred. As well
might I suppose that your monarchical
sympathies deeply interest you in
the autocracy of Dahomey and Dârfur.
A boy may play with a monkey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
without admiring him; and although
the monkey is a biped without feathers,
the boy would not like to have him
taken for a younger brother. Believe
me, we are not yet ready to claim fraternity
with the Provisional Government.
<em>How we apples swim</em>, seems
to be their salutation to America; but,
for one, I reject the odorous impeachment.
No one is very cordial, as yet,
in returning it. There is a general
gaping and staring; but the prevailing
disposition towards France is to
wait and see if she will be decent.
You will agree with me, that this caution
is creditable to the <em>Model Republic</em>.</p>

<p>In the spectacle before us, believe
me, then, we know how to distinguish
the harlequin from the hero, and are
not in danger of clapping hands at the
buffoonery of Paris, when we have
just been charmed by the solemn
buskin in which London came upon
the stage&mdash;reluctant to play her part,
but prepared to go through it nobly.
A French melodrama, of men in
smocks chanting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mourir pour la Patrie</i>,
or priests, in defiled surplices,
asperging and incensing May-poles,
must of course suit the tastes of the
groundlings; but such inexplicable
dumb-shows are generally understood
to be only the prelude to something
tragic that is coming. For one, I look
for solemn monologues from Pio Nono
and Lamartine; and, by-and-by, expect
a scene between the Soldan and
the Czar. I do not look without feelings
of awe, for I am sure it is the
shadow of <span class="smcap">God's</span> own hand that is
now passing over the nations. It is
He that says, as of old, "remove the
diadem and take off the crown; exalt
him that is low, and abase him that
is high." I am glad that others recognise
his footsteps in the earth, and
therefore was pleased with that motto
lately quoted in Maga, from St Augustine&mdash;"<span class="smcap">God</span>
is patient, because He is
eternal."</p>

<p>For seventeen years we have been
watching the great political Humpty-Dumpty,
in his efforts to come to an
equilibrium, and to stand firm in his
place; and the end is, that Humpty-Dumpty
is fallen, according to the
oracular rhyme of Mother Goose.
What shall we say of him, except
that he was barricaded in, and has
been barricaded out? Laugh as we
may at the undefinableness of legitimacy,
one feels that the lack of it
makes a great difference in our disposition
towards a discrowned king.
Still, Louis-Philippe is treated with
much forbearance, and men think of
his hoar hairs and his eventful life.
In one of our newspapers, a generous
word has been spoken for his government,
as about the best that France
deserved, and his best measures have
been reviewed with praise. Still, he
is much disliked in America. One of
his earliest Claremonts was with us;
and when Lafayette made him a king,
Americans felt as if they had a right
to be pleased with his accession. But
his quarrel with his benefactor turned
the feeling strongly against him, for
Lafayette was revered among us to
the hour of his death. I think there
is a general satisfaction with the fall
of the Orleans dynasty; but it certainly
has not been malicious or spiteful.
An eminent American, who has
lived long in Paris, has written two
letters in the leading democratic newspaper
of New York, in which the fallen
monarch is more severely handled
than he has been elsewhere. He is
there said to be a much overrated
man&mdash;possessed of no great talents,
except those which enable him to dissimulate
with the utmost cunning,
and to manage with the basest perfidy.
The writer, nevertheless, has
no confidence in the revolution as
having destroyed the monarchy; and
quotes with approbation a sentiment
which he says was advanced in conversation
with himself, so long ago as
1830, by Odillon Barrot,&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfin,
monsieur, la France a besoin de se sentir
gouvernée</i>." He thinks two things
will work against the Duc de Bordeaux&mdash;that
he has married an Austrian,
and grown fat; yet he confidently
predicts that Henry V. will
one day ascend the throne of his ancestors.
"As for a republic that is to
go on harmoniously, and with any
thing like tolerable quiet, law, and
order," he concludes, "I hold it to be
just as impracticable as it would be
to set up a Doge of Venice and a
Council of Ten in the State of New
York. <em>We hear only the voices of the
revolutionists</em>, the rest of the nation
being temporarily mute. The day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
will come, however, when the last
will speak."</p>

<p>These sentiments are not singular
among us. I am agreeably surprised
by the great moderation of our people
and of our press. When the tidings
of the outbreak reached us, it produced
excitement, of course; but there was
no echo of the French howl, and remarkably
little enthusiasm, all things
considered. You have seen reprinted
in England some of the most foolish
things that were said in our most
worthless prints. The press in general
behaved with great reserve and
caution. Successive steamers brought
continual abatements to the degree of
confidence, or hope, that had been
inspired in the minds of the more
ardent; and so general was the candour
of the newspapers, that when
those of the Clay party were pettishly
accused of a sympathy with
tyranny, the charge was easily met
by quotations from democratic newspapers,
equally liable to the imputation,
if a manly reprobation of revolutionary
misrule and excess be sufficient
to prove it. The truth is, our country
was caught in the trap in 1792. Then,
the pulpit and the press strove together
in glorifying France; and the remorse
and burning shame that were the consequence,
have left a very salutary
impression.</p>

<p>In fact, the violent democracy of
Paris is exerting a beneficial effect
upon our people. We see the degrading
spectacle, and learn to value
ourselves for a love of law and order.
There is a reluctance to reduce ourselves
to the level of such a republic as
has sprung up like a mushroom in a
night, and is likely to perish in the same
way. Our own revolution was not
one of drunken riot, and street-singing
blouse-men: our constitution is not
a mere poetical theory of liberty and
equality, nor a socialist's dream of
brotherhood. We now learn the
secret of our strength, and of that
comparative durability which has
almost surprised ourselves. We are,
after all, a transplanted slip of old
England; nor are we so essentially
changed, my Basil, as even you
imagine. The spirit of our people is
indeed democratic; but the spirit of
our constitution is imbued with a
stronger element. The facts concerning
it will enable you to see one secret
of our comparative success, and to
judge whether France can possibly
come to any thing as good. The
founders of this republic were not
Frenchmen, but Englishmen; I mean
they were of English stock, and had
learned all their notions of liberty
from the history of England. Each
province of America had taken shape
under the British constitution; and
when the provinces became independent,
the general government was
organised in such wise as to supply
the place of that constitution. Its
founders did not frame a new and
untried constitution, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">priori</i>, according
to their own schemes; they simply
modified the great principles of British
constitutional law to suit a new state
of things, and a peculiar people. A
monarchy was out of the question;
but they did not intend to make a
democracy. They only made a republic.
The democratic spirit came in
with Jefferson and French politics at
the beginning of the present century.
It has become dominant, but by no
means triumphant; and its great obstacle
has been the constitution. In
the several states it has changed the
constitutions one after the other, introducing
universal suffrage, and
other democratic features. But the
national constitution has not been so
easily reached; and it is the strength
of the great party with which Clay
and Webster are identified, and which
is a constant check on the popular
party. It is republican, but not
simply democratic. The executive
magistracy is elective; but the electors
are not the people, directly, but electoral
colleges, appointed by the several
states; and the office itself is endowed
with prerogatives, some of which are
more unlimited than the corresponding
rights of the British crown. Our senate
is a mere modification of the House of
Lords: it is a body more select than
the lower house, and not so immediately
responsible to constituents; and
its practical working shows the great
importance of such a balance-wheel
in any government. There is no working
without it, in spite of what your
Roebucks may say. The House of
Commons reappears in our House of
Representatives, which, like its great
original, is the safety-valve of popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
feeling, and gives sonorous vent to a
mighty pressure of steam and vapour,
which would otherwise blow us to
atoms, with a much less endurable
noise. The whole fabric of our law
is a precious patrimony derived, with
our blood, from England. Our new
states are filling up with emigrants
from the continent of Europe, but
they all adopt the law of their older
sisters; and thus the institutions of
the immortal Alfred may be found
among the Swedes and Danes of
Wisconsin. These, then, are the
elements of our strength; and you
observe they partake of the strength
of the British empire, which has been
legitimately and naturally imparted
to us, like the mother's life-blood to
the daughter of her womb. We have
indeed characteristic peculiarities.
We have tried some new experiments;
but let not France suppose she can
imitate them. We are a new country,
a sparse population, and our people
have their heads full of subduing
the soil, and setting water-wheels in
streams, and making roads and canals.
We have no natural taste for insurrection
and confusion, for we have
nobody that is idle enough to want
such work. Our new wine, then, has
been put into new bottles; and the
fool that attempts to decant it into
the old vessels of Europe, will ruin it
and them together.</p>

<p>Our newspapers have pointed out
another secret of our strength, which
France cannot possibly enjoy. In
spite of that wild prophecy of Lady
Hester Stanhope to Lamartine&mdash;so
much of which has come true&mdash;Paris
is France, and will be France while
France holds together. The city of
Washington is not America; and its
great acres of unoccupied building
lots are the best thing about it. The
State governments, which could not
have been planned beforehand, but
are a natural product of old events&mdash;which
dispose of all local matters, and
prevent sectional jealousies, which
divide and balance power, and <em>satisfy
small ambition</em>,&mdash;these are the helps,
without which our national existence
could not have been prolonged beyond
the lifetime of Washington himself.
The threatened disturbance of the admirable
equilibrium which has heretofore
been maintained between North
and South, and East and West, by the
introduction of Mexican and Texan
states, and the power which it will
throw into the hands of a few persons
at the seat of government, is even
now our most alarming danger. We
know, from what we see among ourselves,
that governments must take
form, not from human devices, but
from <span class="smcap">God's</span> providences. We ourselves
are the results of circumstances:
no scheming patriot could have made
us what we are; and no imitative
Frenchman can give to his country a
government like ours; nor, if he could,
would it survive beyond the lifetime
of some individual, whose popularity
would supply a temporary strength
to its essential weakness. An imported
constitution must be a sickly
one, in any country on earth.</p>

<p>For us, then, there is a legitimacy
in our institutions which makes them
durable, and dear to all classes of our
people. But to be loyal to our own
republic is by no means to be committed
to universal republicanism, far
less to be delighted with universal
anarchy. You must pardon our tastes.
We are young, and we think a jacket
and shako becoming. We wear our
appropriate costume as gracefully as
we can. We are yet the growing,
perhaps the awkward, but still the
active boy. But when Europe befools
itself, in its dotage, with republican
attire, we lads have a right to laugh.
It will do for us to play leap-frog, or
cut any other caper that we choose;
but who can restrain derision when
corpulent imbecility assumes an unskirted
coat, and submits its uncovered
proportions to hootings and to kicks,
or throws a ponderous summersault
that less demonstrates agility than
exposes nakedness!</p>

<p>I speak for myself, and for many, very
many of my countrymen. Our mere
populace are of course possessed with
the idea that a universal Yankee-doodle
is the panacea for all the miseries
of the world. It has been told them
so often by demagogues, that they are
pardonable. But even they would
probably allow that the <em>Chinese</em>, for
instance, are not yet quite ready for
liberty-poles and ballet-boxes, and by
degrees might be brought to confess
as much for any country less remarkable
and astonishing than our own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
But there is a solid mass of good sense
among us that is not so deceived. It
consists of those who would rejoice to
see a rational republic in France, or
in any other country; but who know
that, with the exception perhaps of
Holland, such a thing is impossible,
and that, in France, reason is more
likely to reappear as the divinified harlot
of Notre Dame than in any more
respectable form. As to Great Britain,
even our schoolboys have learned
that, with all the stability of empire,
it unites the freedom of a republic;
and in spite of some feeling against
John Bull, I scarcely know the man
who would not be sorry to see it
suddenly or violently revolutionised.
On Irish affairs opinion is not so sane
among us. Few of us know any
thing about them; and for the sake of
the starving peasantry of Ireland,
there is some sympathy with its turbulent
Gracchi. Believe it, the general
tone of sentiment on this side the
Atlantic, among reflecting men, is far
more conservative than you imagine.
Indeed, all classes stand amazed at
the democracy of Europe. Our wildest
enthusiasts are outdone, even by
some who sit in the House of Commons;
and the rampant socialism of
Paris is as unlike the worst excesses
of our elections, as the ferocity of a
tiger is unlike the playfulness of a
kitten. Young as we are, we are
better mannered; and I must say,
dear Basil, that when the older nations
of the world are allowing themselves
such license, we have a right to regard
ourselves as taking new rank, and
deserving more credit than has heretofore
been given us, as, after all, a law-loving
and law-maintaining people.</p>

<p>You will say, as was said to the trumpeter
in Æsop&mdash;"No, no,&mdash;you make
all the mischief; others cut throats,
but you have set them on." But
is the democratic spirit really of American
origin? Our Plymouth orators&mdash;the
men who annually glorify our
earliest colonists&mdash;usually trace it to
the Puritans, and through them to
Geneva. At all events, it now infects
the world, and those are the happy
and the permanent governments which
are prepared for its violence, by constitutional
vents and floodgates. It
is not to be stifled, or dammed up.
We believe, therefore, that our own
government is the best for ourselves,
and few of us have any fear for that of
England. On British matters we do
not feel bound to judge by our own
experiences. We are free to theorise
on broader principles; and many of
us form our own opinions, not as cool
and critical foreigners, but as having
a deep interest in the preservation of
the institutions of our ancestors. Why
should we not? The study of history
carries us, at once, beyond the narrow
limits of threescore years and ten,
which is the age of our national existence,
and as soon as we pass that
boundary we too are Britons. The
blood of our forefathers ran in English
veins, or flowed for British freedom
and sovereignty. This fact is
enough to make our educated and
reflecting men speculatively conservative
as to British politics. We
know the past, and do not feel the
party-heats of the present in England.
Hence I am far from being alone
among my countrymen, in looking at
English matters with an English heart.
Even our commercial class have a
reason for wishing internal peace and
prosperity to England; and I believe
there is generally something better
than selfishness in the prevalent good-will
toward her. I wish you could
have watched, as I did, the feelings of
our whole people, while lately, between
the arrivals of two steamers,
there was a solemn feeling of surprise
as to what would be the results of
the Chartist demonstration! Till the
news came, the stoutest of us held
our breath. I assure you, Basil, the
peril of England was observed with a
deep anxiety. During all that time I
met not a respectable man who wished
to see a revolutionary result. It was
the talk of all circles. Our merchants
trembled for England; our scholars
hoped for her; a clerical gentleman
assured me that he daily prayed for
her. The press very generally predicted
a triumph of order, but there
were some specimens of newspaper
literature that ventured an opposite
augury. I wish you could have seen
this city when the result was known.
The news was received with a thrill.
There was some laughing at the parturient
mountain and the still-born
mouse, but a graver cheerfulness was
the reigning emotion. We deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
felt that, by the mercy of God, the
world had been spared from a conflagration
which the match of a madman
could light, but which only
another deluge could extinguish. For
one, I was as a watcher by the sea-side,
who, after a night of tempest,
waits for the fog to rise, and then
thanks God to see the good old ship
coming home, in season, her masts all
standing, and her flag untorn.</p>

<p>I had felt fears, my Basil. What was
not imaginable, when Europe presented
the appearance of a table on which
empires had fallen in a day, like card-houses
blown down by the breath of
children! I knew that neither France,
nor Prussia, nor Austria, nor Italy,
were any thing like England, which is
founded on a rock, and knit together
by joints and bands: but I felt that
England is no longer what she was.
With a Whig government she is never
herself.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The Whigs are more than half
Frenchmen. I tell you you seem to me
not half enough afraid of your Whigs;
they are worse than your Radicals.
You show some uneasiness under the
Jewish Disabilities Bill, but I wish
you could see it as it strikes a looker-on.
If time has on you the effect
which distance has on me, you will yet
look back on that measure as you now
look back on the great mistake of 1829.
It will haunt you like a nightmare, and
you will regard it with less of anger
than of shame and remorse; with
the deep conviction that, if the friends
of the constitution had done their
duty, it never would have disgraced
a Christian state. True, the Whigs
are responsible for inflicting the blow;
but what has been done to avert it?
So far as I know, nothing commensurate
with the greatness of the evil.
You seem to give way to it as only
one of many inroads upon old proprieties,
which are inevitable, and cannot
be withstood. But is the unchristianising
of the state to be spoken of
side by side with even the destruction
of colonies, and the discouragement
of agriculture? As it strikes
me, it is not a thing of a class, it
stands out a portent, a harbinger,
a phenomenon of its own kind. Not
that it surprises me. From Lord
John Russell nothing that argues
fatuity and lack of political principle
should surprise any one. To carry out
the plans to which he has committed
himself, he must consistently pander to
infidels, foster heretics, and subsidise
Jews. To the reforms of the last
score of years, there could be no more
fitting sequel than this coalition
with a people loaded with the
hereditary burthen of the saving
blood of the Crucified. I only marvel
that the bill goes on so slowly. The
Baron should have been long since in
his place, and the Easter holidays
should have been disregarded, out of
respect to his feelings. It is astonishing
that he is not already an ecclesiastical
commissioner. The times are
not now as during a former French
revolution, when a British statesman
could say<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;"the Jews in Change
Alley have not yet dared to hint their
hopes of a mortgage on the revenues
belonging to the see of Canterbury."
You are always praising your church,
Basil, but allow me to ask, Why you
may not live to see a Jewish rabbi
nominated to a bishopric. As I understand
it, the obsequious chapter
would be obliged to perform the election,
and close all by anthems to
Almighty <span class="smcap">God</span>, ascribing to Him the
glory of a gift so felicitous and so
auspicious to the church! It would
not be the first time, I believe, that
Lord John has set the <em>Te Deum</em> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
cathedrals going, like the whistles of a
juggler's barrel-organ. Forgive me,
Basil; I am not mocking the agonies
of your church, but I am scorning a
British minister that can use for her
destruction the powers confided to him
for her nourishment and defence. I
have learned my notions of your politics
from Edmund Burke, and I remember
what he said in his <cite>Reflections
on the French Revolution of 1792</cite>&mdash;for,
by the way, revolutions in France
must be always referred to by dates,
and will soon be known, like policemen,
by letters and numbers. "The
men of England," said that great and
honest man, "the men I mean of
light and leading in England, would be
ashamed, as of a silly deceitful trick, to
profess any religion in name which, by
their proceedings, they appear to contemn."
Does not Lord John profess to
be a Christian? I must caution you,
too, against supposing that I dislike
the Israelites. Far from it. In my
own country I am glad that they
labour under no disabilities, and I can
testify to their good order, decency,
and propriety of behaviour as citizens.
But we have "no past at our back,"
and nothing in our system which demands
a prior consideration. No,
Basil&mdash;I honour a Jew, however much
I may pity him. Crying old clothes,
or lolling in a banker's chariot, the
Jew is to me a man of sacred associations.
And then&mdash;a Jewish gentleman&mdash;he
makes me think at once of
the sons of Maccabæus and all the
Asmoneans; those Hebrews of the
Hebrews, those Tories of Israel! What
natural sympathy has a Jewish gentleman
with a Whig? Were I merely
covetous of votes I would say&mdash;let the
Jews in! I could trust <em>their</em> conscience;
I could appeal to their own feelings;
I would put it to them whether their
liberalism would consent to eat pork
with the Gentiles, or to call in the
uncircumcised to make laws for the
synagogue. We pity the blindness of
the Jews that offered their thirty
pieces of silver&mdash;but we do not despise
them. Our contempt settles on the
head of the Christian who consented
to take them at the bargain.</p>

<p>You speak of this Jew bill as the
first step! Why, yes, the first step in
tragedy; there was a former one in
farce. There is Sir Moses Montefiore!
Who made him a knight? "A Jewish
knight," said I, at the time&mdash;"hear
it, ye dry bones,&mdash;ye cross-legged
effigies&mdash;ye Paladins&mdash;ye Templars!
Hear it, Du-Bois-Gilbert,&mdash;hear
it, Richard Cœur-de-Lion! Yes,
and thou, too, old Roger de Coverley!
Hear it, thou true old English knight;
for they that bought thine old clothes
now come for thine old spurs!" So
said I&mdash;wondering that no one seemed
to wonder. The nineteenth century
had not time to stare. There was not
even a London <em>Punch</em> to laugh at such
a <em>Judy</em>, and so Moses was belted and
spurred, no man gainsaying; and
knighthood, that was Sidney's once,
is just the thing for Sir Peter Laurie
now.</p>

<p>And if a Jewish knight, why not a
Jewish senator! True, there is something
grand in the idea of a nation
that never, since the Wittenagemote,
has seen a lawgiver unbaptised; and
then there is still a red cross in the
flag of England; and there has been
a pleasing notion that the Christian
faith was part and parcel with the
British constitution; and even we in
America, averse to church and state,
have long allowed ourselves to admire
one exception to the rule, and to confess
the majestic figure made among
the nations by a Christian empire,
shining forth in splendid contrast to
surrounding kingdoms, some of them
infidel and some of them superstitious,
but she alone the witness to reasonable
faith, and faithful reason. But
who regards it in this light? Who
among you stands up to warn his
country of the glory that is departing?
Who has said any thing in parliament
at all adequate to the turning-point of
a nation's religion? I have looked for
some one to speak as Burke would have
spoken, of "uncovering your nakedness,
by throwing off that Christian
religion which has hitherto been your
boast and comfort." I have longed
to see his promise made good,&mdash;"<em>we
shall never be such fools</em> as to call in an
enemy to the substance of any system,
to remove its corruptions, to supply
its defects, or to perfect its construction."
I read <cite>The Times</cite>, but as yet I
have looked in vain. A few honest
remonstrances have indeed been ventured
amid cries of <em>oh, oh!</em> and vociferations
of buck-toothed laughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
from the benches that support the
honourable members from Cottonburgh
and Calicopolis. But who has
stood up as for altars and fires? I
hope, ere this reaches you, the question
will be creditably answered. I
hope the Christianity of England will
not die without a struggle. I suspect
it will be of no use, but I look yet for
some John of Gaunt in the House of
Lords. Imagine him, my Basil:&mdash;</p>

<p>This is what ought to be said; and
I look for it, if not from lords spiritual,
then even from lords temporal. But
surely it would well become the primate's
mouth! Of course, it would
do little good; but then the religion
of England would fall at least dramatically.
It would make a picture
quite as good as the death of Chatham.
Do you remember the lawn-sleeves in
that picture? The bishops are "in at
the death,"&mdash;but nothing more.</p>

<p>But another steamer has come in
with news; and France is all the
talk. The elections are over; the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Modérés</i> have triumphed; the National
Assembly has convened, and the Provisional
Government is at an end.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive Lamartine!</i> Of course the stock
of the republic takes a rise, but
holders are not firm. The bloodshed
at Rouen, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émeutes</i> at Elbœuf and
Limoges, and the threats of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Communistes</i>,
do not precisely inspire confidence.
Still, we are so far surprised, and
those who have predicted favourably
for France grow a little more sanguine
in their hopes. I am glad to say that
Louis Blanc has no sympathisers
here. All are convinced that Lamartine
will make the best of it, and that,
if he fails, the republic will be suffocated
and expire in a stench. For
one, it seems to me that Lamartine is
not bad enough to encounter successfully
the frantic malice of his opponents,
and that their eventual success is certain.
Already, things have very likely
taken a decisive turn, and by the time
this letter reaches you, the doings of
the Assembly will have enabled you
to conjecture whether the nation is
going by the long way, or the short
cut, to Henry Fifth. As all will be
stale before you can read what I now
write, I will not presume to predict
the immediate results; but I am sure
that the assembling of such a set as
have been returned to the legislature,
would be enough to blow up the
strongest government on earth. Jew,
Dominican, pastor and bishop, poet
and butcher, all in their tricoloured
sashes&mdash;was there ever such a full-blown
tulip-bed of liberty, equality,
and fraternity!</p>

<p>The announcement of several clergymen
as members of the Assembly
reminds me that there has been some
sickly sentiment among us, about the
<em>piety</em> that has been displayed in this
revolution. In Boston we are favoured
with some strange types of
religions enthusiasm; in fact, the
type of Christianity that prevails
among us is peculiarly our own; and like
our improvements in machinery, deserves
the proverbial name of a "Boston
notion." Emerson, who is now
illuminating England, may give you
some idea of what I mean; and a
queer story that is told of one of his
disciples, may furnish you with an explanation
of the fact, that some men
see religion in the sacking of the Tuileries.
The youth was at the Opera
to see a celebrated <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">danseuse</i>, and excited
general attention by his somewhat
extraordinary applause. His
enthusiasm so transported him, that
the emotions of his heart became unconsciously
audible. As the dancer began
to whirl, he cried, "<em>Ah, that is
poetry!</em>" As she stretched her toe to the
horizontal, he exclaimed, "<em>That's divinity!</em>"
but when she proceeded to an
evolution that forced the ladies to pay
attention to their fans, he burst into the
climax&mdash;"<em>That's religion!</em>" If this be
caricature, the Emersonians richly deserve
it. They are laughed at even in
Boston. But they are not alone in thinking
well of the piety of Paris, and arguing
from it that there will be no reign
of terror; as if there was not vastly
more show of religion in the first revolution!
If there is an archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of Paris now, there was formerly a
Talleyrand for high-priest and master
of ceremonies. Oh, but they rejoin
with a story! When the blouses were
gutting the palace of its pictures and
marbles, they found, among other
works of art, an image of the Crucified.
As a blouseman was about to dash it
to atoms, there was a cry, "Save it&mdash;save
the great teacher of fraternity!"
The crucifix was accordingly saved,
and borne about the streets amid
songs and curses, and, very appropriately,
"with lanterns and torches."
"<em>Ah, that's religion!</em>" says your Emersonian.
So, when recreant priests
baptise a liberty-pole, or join a procession
of blouses, with crosses and
censers, <em>that's divinity</em>, at least. Was
ever hypocrisy so revolting! The
nauseous mockery has its only parallel
in the writings of George Sand, who
makes a favourite hero and heroine
betake themselves to an adulterous
bed, after duly reciting their prayers,
in which the absent husband is very
affectionately remembered. If a revolution
thus begun is not destined to
go speedily through all the ripening
and rotting of a godless anarchy, it is
to be accounted for only on the principle
that "He who is Eternal can
wait." The old scene at Notre Dame
may not be actually revived, and the
Bible may not be literally dragged
through Paris again tied to an ass's
tail; but the undisguised atrocities of
the first revolution may, after all, be
exceeded by the smooth-faced blasphemies
of that which has already degraded
the world's Redeemer into the
patron saint of insurrection, and the
father of infidel fraternity.</p>

<p>Poor Lamartine! Is this the man,
my Basil, whom you once likened to
Chateaubriand? <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quantum mutatus!</i>
I knew him, till lately, only as a poet
and a traveller. He certainly went
to Palestine with the spirit of a
palmer. He bathed in Siloa with enthusiasm,
and almost expired of feeling
under the venerable olive-trees of
Gethsemane.</p>

<p>How Frenchy&mdash;how intensely
French! mass in the morning, and
weeping and sighing,&mdash;a revel before
nightfall, and desperate gaming. And
this man to be the Cromwell of the
commonwealth? He could hardly
have been the Milton, though it would
have been more becoming. And what
will be his career? It is a pity Lady
Hester Stanhope was not permitted to
consult his stars in full when he met
her on Mount Lebanon, when she
praised his handsome foot and arched
instep, and told him he should be very
important in the history of the world.
Ah, how certainly he will yet lament,
if he does not lament already, the fulfilment
of the oracle! Such weird
sisters as Lady Hester generally tell
<em>only half</em>, leaving the rest to imagination
and to time. But whether this
Phaeton, who has grasped the reins,
is to set the world on fire; whether
he, in turn, is only to try the game of
Humpty-Dumpty and to fall; or whether,
even as I write this, he be not
already under the foot of Louis Blanc
and his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Communistes</i>,&mdash;what probabilities
or improbabilities shall aid my conjecture?
This thing only will I venture
as my surmise, though not my
hope, that kings shall reign again in
France, as if Lamartine never lived:
that tricoloured cockades shall be
made no more, and lilies be cultivated
again: that there will soon be longings
for a sight of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">drapeau blanc</i>, and
a prince of the sons of St Louis: and
that, fat as he is, and Bourbon as he
is, and half Austrian as he has made
himself, Henry Duke of Bordeaux
will soon be known as <span class="smcap">Henri le
Désiré</span>.</p>

<p>
Yours ever, my dear Basil,</p>
<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Ernest</span>.

<h2>THE CAXTONS&mdash;PART IV.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>


<p>I was always an early riser. Happy
the man who is! Every morning,
day comes to him with a virgin's
love, full of bloom, and purity, and
freshness. The youth of nature is
contagious, like the gladness of a
happy child. I doubt if any man
can be called 'old' so long as he
is an early riser, and an early
<em>walker</em>. And oh, youth!&mdash;take my
word of it,&mdash;youth in dressing-gown
and slippers, dawdling over breakfast
at noon, is a very decrepid ghastly
image of that youth which sees the sun
blush over the mountains, and the dews
sparkle upon blossoming hedgerows.</p>

<p>Passing by my father's study, I
was surprised to see the windows unclosed&mdash;surprised
more, on looking in,
to see him bending over his books&mdash;for
I had never before known him
study till after the morning meal.
Students are not usually early risers,
for students, alas! whatever their age,
are rarely young. Yes; the great
work must be getting on in serious
earnest. It was no longer dalliance
with learning: this was work.</p>

<p>I passed through the gates into the
road. A few of the cottages were
giving signs of returning life; but it
was not yet the hour for labour, and
no "Good morning, sir," greeted me
on the road. Suddenly at a turn,
which an overhanging beech-tree had
before concealed, I came full upon my
Uncle Roland.</p>

<p>"What! you, sir? So early? Hark,
the clock is striking five!"</p>

<p>"Not later! I have walked well
for a lame man. It must be more
than four miles to &mdash;&mdash; and back."</p>

<p>"You have been to &mdash;&mdash;: not on
business? No soul would be up."</p>

<p>"Yes, at inns there is always some
one up. Ostlers never sleep! I have
been to order my humble chaise and
pair. I leave you to day, nephew."</p>

<p>"Ah, uncle, we have offended you.
It was my folly&mdash;that cursed print&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said my uncle, quickly.
"Offended me, boy! I defy you!"
and he pressed my hand roughly.</p>

<p>"Yet this sudden determination!
It was but yesterday, at the Roman
Camp, that you planned an excursion
with my father to C&mdash;&mdash; Castle."</p>

<p>"Never depend upon a whimsical
man. I must be in London to-night."</p>

<p>"And return to morrow?"</p>

<p>"I know not when," said my uncle,
gloomily; and he was silent for some
moments. At length, leaning less
lightly on my arm, he continued&mdash;"Young
man, you have pleased me. I
love that open saucy brow of yours, on
which nature has written 'Trust me.'
I love those clear eyes that look man
manfully in the face. I must know
more of you&mdash;much of you. You must
come and see me some day or other in
your ancestor's ruined keep."</p>

<p>"Come! that I will. And you shall
show me the old tower&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the traces of the out-works;"
cried my uncle, flourishing
his stick.</p>

<p>"And the pedigree&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, and your great-great-grandfather's
armour, which he wore at
Marston Moor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the brass plate in the
church, uncle."</p>

<p>"The deuce is in the boy! Come
here&mdash;come here; I've three minds to
break your head, sir!"</p>

<p>"It is a pity somebody had not
broken the rascally printer's, before he
had the impudence to disgrace us by
having a family, uncle."</p>

<p>Captain Roland tried hard to frown,
but he could not. "Pshaw!" said he,
stopping, and taking snuff. "The
world of the dead is wide; why should
the ghosts jostle us?"</p>

<p>"We can never escape the ghosts,
uncle. They haunt us always. We
cannot think or act, but the soul of
some man, who has lived before,
points the way. The dead never die,
especially since&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Since what, boy? you speak well."</p>

<p>"Since our great ancestor introduced
printing," said I, majestically.</p>

<p>My uncle whistled "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Malbrook
s'en va-t-en guerre</i>."</p>

<p>I had not the heart to plague him
further.</p>

<p>"Peace!" said I, creeping cautiously
within the circle of the stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"No! I forewarn you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace! and describe to me my
little cousin, your pretty daughter&mdash;for
pretty I am sure she is."</p>

<p>"Peace," said my uncle, smiling.
"But you must come and judge for
yourself."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p>Uncle Roland was gone. Before he
went, he was closeted for an hour with
my father, who then accompanied
him to the gate; and we all crowded
round him as he stepped into his
chaise. When the Captain was gone,
I tried to sound my father as to
the cause of so sudden a departure.
But my father was impenetrable in
all that related to his brother's
secrets. Whether or not the Captain
had ever confided to him the cause
of his displeasure with his son,&mdash;a
mystery which much haunted me,&mdash;my
father was mute on that score,
both to my mother and myself. For
two or three days, however, Mr
Caxton was evidently unsettled. He
did not even take to his great work;
but walked much alone, or accompanied
only by the duck, and without
even a book in his hand. But by
degrees the scholarly habits returned
to him; my mother mended his pens,
and the work went on.</p>

<p>For my part, left much to myself,
especially in the mornings, I began
to muse restlessly over the future.
Ungrateful that I was, the happiness
of home ceased to content me. I
heard afar the roar of the great world,
and roved impatient by the shore.</p>

<p>At length, one evening, my father,
with some modest hums and ha's, and
an-unaffected blush on his fair forehead,
gratified a prayer frequently
urged on him, and read me some portions
of "the great Work." I cannot
express the feelings this lecture
created&mdash;they were something akin
to awe. For the design of this book
was so immense&mdash;and towards its
execution, a learning so vast and
various had administered&mdash;that it
seemed to me as if a spirit had
opened to me a new world, which had
always been before my feet, but which
my own human blindness had hitherto
concealed from me. The unspeakable
patience with which all
these materials had been collected
year after year&mdash;the ease with which
now, by the calm power of genius,
they seemed of themselves to fall into
harmony and system&mdash;the unconscious
humility with which the scholar
exposed the stores of a laborious
life;&mdash;all combined to rebuke my
own restlessness and ambition, while
they filled me with a pride in my
father, which saved my wounded
egotism from a pang. Here, indeed,
was one of those books which embrace
an existence; like the Dictionary of
Bayle, or the History of Gibbon, or
the <cite>Fasti Hellenici</cite> of Clinton,&mdash;it
was a book to which thousands of
books had contributed, only to make
the originality of the single mind more
bold and clear. Into the furnace all
vessels of gold, of all ages, had been
cast, but from the mould came the
new coin, with its single stamp. And
happily, the subject of the work did
not forbid to the writer the indulgence
of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïve</i>, peculiar irony of humour&mdash;so
quiet, yet so profound. My
father's book was the "History of
Human Error." It was, therefore,
the moral history of mankind, told
with truth and earnestness, yet with
an arch unmalignant smile. Sometimes,
indeed, the smile drew tears.
But in all true humour lies its germ,
pathos. Oh! by the goddess Moria or
Folly, but he was at home in his theme!
He viewed man first in the savage
state, preferring in this the positive
accounts of voyagers and travellers,
to the vague myths of antiquity, and
the dreams of speculators on our
pristine state. From Australia and
Abyssinia, he drew pictures of mortality
unadorned, as lively as if he
had lived amongst Bushmen and
savages all his life. Then he crossed
over the Atlantic, and brought before
you the American Indian, with his
noble nature, struggling into the
dawn of civilisation, when friend
Penn cheated him out of his birthright,
and the Anglo-Saxon drove
him back into darkness. He showed
both analogy and contrast between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
this specimen of our kind, and others
equally apart from the extremes of
the savage state and the cultured.
The Arab in his tent, the Teuton
in his forests, the Greenlander in his
boat, the Fin in his rein-deer car.
Up sprang the rude gods of the north,
and the resuscitated Druidism, passing
from its earliest templeless belief
into the later corruptions of crommell
and idol. Up sprang, by their side,
the Saturn of the Phœnicians, the
mystic Budh of India, the elementary
deities of the Pelasgian, the
Naith and Serapis of Egypt, the
Ormuzd of Persia, the Bel of Babylon,
the winged genii of the graceful
Etruria. How nature and life shaped
the religion; how the religion shaped
the manners; how, and by what influences,
some tribes were formed for
progress; how others were destined
to remain stationary, or be swallowed
up in war and slavery by their
brethren, was told with a precision
clear and strong as the voice of Fate.
Not only an antiquarian and philologist,
but an anatomist and philosopher&mdash;my
father brought to bear on all
these grave points, the various speculations
involved in the distinctions of
race. He showed how race in perfection
is produced, up to a certain
point, by admixture: how all mixed
races have been the most intelligent&mdash;how,
in proportion as local circumstance
and religious faith permitted the
early fusion of differing tribes, races
improved and quickened into the refinements
of civilisation. He tracked
the progress and dispersion of the
Hellenes, from their mythical cradle in
Thessaly; and showed how those who
settled near the sea-shores, and were
compelled into commerce and intercourse
with strangers, gave to Greece
her marvellous accomplishments in arts
and letters&mdash;the flowers of the ancient
world. How others, like the Spartans,
dwelling evermore in a camp, on guard
against their neighbours, and rigidly
preserving their Dorian purity of extraction,
contributed neither artists, nor
poets, nor philosophers to the golden
treasure-house of mind. He took the
old race of the Celts, Cimry, or Cimmerians.
He compared the Celt who,
as in Wales, the Scotch Highlands,
in Bretagne, and in uncomprehended
Ireland, retains his old characteristics
and purity of breed, with the Celt
whose blood, mixed by a thousand
channels, dictates from Paris the manners
and revolutions of the world. He
compared the Norman in his ancient
Scandinavian home, with that wonder
of intelligence and chivalry which he
became, fused imperceptibly with the
Frank, the Goth, and the Anglo-Saxon.
He compared the Saxon, stationary
in the land of Horsa, with the
colonist and civiliser of the globe, as he
becomes, when he knows not through
what channels&mdash;French, Flemish,
Danish, Welch, Scotch, and Irish&mdash;he
draws his sanguine blood. And out
from all these speculations, to which I
do such hurried and scanty justice,
he drew the blessed truth, that carries
hope to the land of the Caffre, the hut
of the Bushman&mdash;that there is nothing
in the flattened skull and the ebon
aspect that rejects God's law, improvement;
that by the same principle
which raises the dog, the lowest of
the animals in its savage state, to the
highest after man,&mdash;viz. admixture
of race&mdash;you can elevate into nations
of majesty and power the outcasts of
humanity, now your compassion or
your scorn. But when my father got
into the marrow of his theme&mdash;when,
quitting these preliminary discussions,
he fell pounce amongst the would-be
wisdom of the wise; when he dealt
with civilisation itself, its schools, and
porticos, and academies; when he bared
the absurdities couched beneath the colleges
of the Egyptians, and the Symposia
of the Greeks;&mdash;when he showed
that, even in their own favourite pursuit
of metaphysics, the Greeks were
children; and in their own more practical
region of politics, the Romans
were visionaries and bunglers;&mdash;when,
following the stream of error through
the middle ages, he quoted the puerilities
of Agrippa, the crudities of
Cardan; and passed, with his calm
smile, into the <em>salons</em> of the chattering
wits of Paris in the eighteenth century,
oh, then his irony was that of Lucian,
sweetened by the gentle spirit of Erasmus.
For not even here was my
father's satire of the cheerless and Mephistophelian
school. From this record
of error he drew forth the grand eras
of truth. He showed how earnest men
never think in vain, though their
thoughts may be errors. He proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
how, in vast cycles, age after age, the
human mind marches on&mdash;like the
ocean, receding here, but there advancing.
How from the speculations
of the Greek sprang all true philosophy;
how from the institutions of the
Roman rose all durable systems of government;
how from the robust follies of
the North came the glory of chivalry,
and the modern delicacies of honour,
and the sweet harmonising influences
of woman. He tracked the ancestry
of our Sidneys and Bayards from the
Hengists, Genserics, and Attilas. Full
of all curious and quaint anecdote&mdash;of
original illustration&mdash;of those niceties
of learning which spring from a taste
cultivated to the last exquisite polish&mdash;the
book amused, and allured, and
charmed; and erudition lost its pedantry
now in the simplicity of Montaigne,
now in the penetration of La
Bruyère. He lived in each time of
which he wrote, and the time lived
again in him. Ah, what a writer of
romances he would have been, if&mdash;if
what? If he had had as sad an experience
of men's passions, as he had
the happy intuition into their humours.
But he who would see the mirror of
the shore, must look where it is cast
on the river, not the ocean. The narrow
stream reflects the gnarled tree,
and the pausing herd, and the village
spire, and the romance of the landscape.
But the sea reflects only the
vast outline of the headland, and the
lights of the eternal heaven.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p>"It is Lombard Street to a China
orange," quoth Uncle Jack.</p>

<p>"Are the odds in favour of fame
against failure so great? You do not
speak, I fear, from experience, brother
Jack," answered my father, as he
stooped down to tickle the duck under
the left ear.</p>

<p>"But Jack Tibbets is not Augustine
Caxton. Jack Tibbets is not a
scholar, a genius, a wond&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop," cried my father.</p>

<p>"After all," said Mr Squills,
"though I am no flatterer, Mr Tibbets
is not so far out.... That part of your
book which compares the crania or
skulls of the different races is superb.
Lawrence or Dr Pritchard could not
have done the thing more neatly.
Such a book must not be lost to the
world; and I agree with Mr Tibbets
that you should publish as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>"It is one thing to write and another
to publish," said my father irresolutely.
"When one considers all
the great men who have published;
when one thinks one is going to intrude
one's-self audaciously into the company
of Aristotle and Bacon, of
Locke, of Herder&mdash;of all the grave
philosophers who bend over nature
with brows weighty with thought&mdash;one
may well pause, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" interrupted Uncle Jack;
"science is not a club, it is an ocean.
It is open to the cockboat as the frigate.
One man carries across it a
freightage of ingots, another may fish
there for herrings. Who can exhaust
the sea? who say to intellect, the deeps
of philosophy are preoccupied?"</p>

<p>"Admirable!" cried Squills.</p>

<p>"So it is really your advice, my
friends," said my father, who seemed
struck by Uncle Jack's eloquent illustration,
"that I should desert my
household gods; remove to London,
since my own library ceases to supply
my wants; take lodgings near the
British Museum, and finish off one
volume, at least, incontinently."</p>

<p>"It is a duty you owe to your
country," said Uncle Jack, solemnly.</p>

<p>"And to yourself," urged Squills.
"One must attend to the natural evacuations
of the brain. Ah! you may
smile, sir; but I have observed that if
a man has much in his head, he must
give it vent or it oppresses him; the
whole system goes wrong. From
being abstracted, he grows stupefied.
The weight of the pressure affects the
nerves. I would not even guarantee
you from a stroke of paralysis."</p>

<p>"Oh, Austin!" cried my mother
tenderly, and throwing her arms round
my father's neck.</p>

<p>"Come, sir, you are conquered,"
said I.</p>

<p>"And what is to become of you,
Sisty?" asked my father. "Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
go with us, and unsettle your mind
for the university?"</p>

<p>"My uncle has invited me to his
castle; and in the meanwhile I will
stay here, fag hard, and take care of
the duck."</p>

<p>"All alone?" said my mother.</p>

<p>"No. All alone! Why Uncle
Jack will come here as often as ever,
I hope."</p>

<p>Uncle Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, my boy&mdash;I must go to town
with your father. You don't understand
these things. I shall see the
booksellers for him. I know how these
gentlemen are to be dealt with. I
shall prepare the literary circles for
the appearance of the book. In short,
it is a sacrifice of interest I know. My
Journal will suffer. But friendship
and my country's good before all
things!"</p>

<p>"Dear Jack!" said my mother affectionately.</p>

<p>"I cannot suffer it," cried my
father. "You are making a good
income. You are doing well where
you are; and as to seeing the
booksellers&mdash;why, when the work is
ready, you can come to town for a
week, and settle that affair."</p>

<p>"Poor dear Austin," said Uncle
Jack, with an air of superiority and
compassion. "A week! Sir, the
advent of a book that is to succeed
requires the preparation of months.
Pshaw! I am no genius, bu I am a
practical man. I know what's what.
Leave me alone."</p>

<p>But my father continued obstinate
and Uncle Jack at last ceased to urge
the matter. The journey to fame and
London was now settled; but my
father would not hear of my staying
behind.</p>

<p>No; Pisistratus must needs go
also to town and see the world; the
duck would take care of itself.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p>We had taken the precaution to
send, the day before, to secure our
due complement of places&mdash;four in all
(including one for Mrs Primmins)&mdash;in,
or upon, the fast family coach called
the Sun, which had lately been set up
for the special convenience of the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This luminary, rising in a town
about seven miles distant from us,
described at first a very erratic orbit
amidst the contiguous villages before
it finally struck into the high-road of
enlightenment, and thence performed
its journey, in the full eyes of man, at
the majestic pace of six miles and a
half an hour. My father, with his
pockets full of books, and a quarto
of "Gebelin on the Primitive World"
for light reading under his arm; my
mother, with a little basket, containing
sandwiches and biscuits of her
own baking; Mrs Primmins, with a
new umbrella, purchased for the occasion,
and a bird-cage containing a
canary, endeared to her not more by
song than age, and a severe pip through
which she had successfully nursed it&mdash;and
I myself, waited at the gates to
welcome the celestial visitor. The
gardener, with a wheel-barrow full of
boxes and portmanteaus, stood a little
in the van; and the footman, who was
to follow when lodgings had been
found, had gone to a rising eminence
to watch the dawning of the expected
planet, and apprise us of its approach
by the concerted signal of a handkerchief
fixed to a stick.</p>

<p>The quaint old house looked at us
mournfully from all its deserted windows.
The litter before its threshold,
and in its open hall; wisps of straw
or hay that had been used for packing;
baskets and boxes that had been
examined and rejected; others, corded
and piled, reserved to follow with the
footman: and the two heated and
hurried serving-women left behind
standing half-way between house and
garden-gate, whispering to each other,
and looking as if they had not slept
for weeks&mdash;gave to a scene, usually so
trim and orderly, an aspect of pathetic
abandonment and desolation. The
genius of the place seemed to reproach
us. I felt the omens were against us,
and turned my earnest gaze from the
haunts behind with a sigh, as the
coach now drew up in all its grandeur.
An important personage, who, despite
the heat of the day, was enveloped
in a vast superfluity of belcher, in the
midst of which galloped a gilt fox, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
who rejoiced in the name of "guard,"
descended to inform us politely that
only three places, two inside and one
out, were at our disposal, the rest
having been pre-engaged a fortnight
before our orders were received.</p>

<p>Now, as I knew that Mrs Primmins
was indispensable to the comforts of
my honoured parents, (the more so,
as she had once lived in London, and
knew all its ways,) I suggested that
she should take the outside seat, and
that I should perform the journey on
foot&mdash;a primitive mode of transport
which has its charms to a young man
with stout limbs and gay spirits. The
guard's outstretched arm left my mother
little time to oppose this proposition,
to which my father assented
with a silent squeeze of the hand.
And, having promised to join them at
a family hotel near the Strand, to
which Mr Squills lad recommended
them as peculiarly genteel and quiet,
and waved my last farewell to my poor
mother, who continued to stretch her
meek face out of the window till the
coach was whirled off in a cloud like
one of the Homeric heroes, I turned
within, to put up a few necessary articles
in a small knapsack, which I
remembered to have seen in the lumber-room,
and which had appertained
to my maternal grandfather; and with
that on my shoulder, and a strong
staff in my hand, I set off towards the
great city at as brisk a pace as if I
were only bound to the next village.
Accordingly, about noon, I was both
tired and hungry; and seeing by the
wayside one of those pretty inns yet
peculiar to England, but which, thanks
to the railways, will soon be amongst
the things before the Flood, I sate
down at a table under some clipped
limes, unbuckled my knapsack, and
ordered my simple fare, with the
dignity of one who, for the first
time in his life, bespeaks his own
dinner, and pays for it out of his own
pocket.</p>

<p>While engaged on a rasher of bacon
and a tankard of what the landlord
called "No mistake," two pedestrians,
passing the same road which I had
traversed, paused, cast a simultaneous
look at my occupation, and, induced
no doubt by its allurements, seated
themselves under the same lime-trees,
though at the farther end of the table.
I surveyed the new-comers with the
curiosity natural to my years.</p>

<p>The elder of the two might have
attained the age of thirty, though
sundry deep lines, and hues formerly
florid and now faded, speaking of
fatigue, care, or dissipation, might
have made him look somewhat older
than he was. There was nothing
very prepossessing in his appearance.
He was dressed with a pretension ill
suited to the costume appropriate to a
foot-traveller. His coat was pinched
and padded; two enormous pins, connected
by a chain, decorated a very
stiff stock of blue satin, dotted with
yellow stars; his hands were cased
in very dingy gloves which had once
been straw-coloured, and the said
hands played with a whalebone cane
surmounted by a formidable knob,
which gave it the appearance of a "life-preserver."
As he took off a white napless
hat, which he wiped with great
care and affection with the sleeve of
his right arm, a profusion of stiff
curls instantly betrayed the art of
man. Like my landlord's ale, in
that wig there was "no mistake:"
it was brought&mdash;(in the fashion of the
wigs we see in the popular effigies of
George IV. in his youth)&mdash;low over
his forehead and raised at the top.
The wig had been oiled, and the oil
had imbibed no small quantity of dust;
oil and dust had alike left their impression
on the forehead and cheeks
of the wig's proprietor. For the rest,
the expression of his face was somewhat
impudent and reckless, but not
without a certain drollery in the corners
of his eyes.</p>

<p>The younger man was apparently
about my own age, a year or two
older perhaps&mdash;judging rather from
his set and sinewy frame than his boyish
countenance. And this last, boyish
as it was, could not fail to demand
the attention even of the most careless
observer. It had not only the darkness
but the character of the gipsy
face, with large brilliant eyes, raven
hair, long and wavy, but not curling;
the features were aquiline but delicate,
and when he spoke he showed
teeth dazzling as pearls. It was impossible
not to admire the singular
beauty of the countenance; and yet,
it had that expression at once stealthy
and fierce, which war with society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
has stamped upon the lineaments of
the race of which it reminded me.
But, withal, there was somewhat of
the air of a gentleman in this young
wayfarer. His dress consisted of a
black velveteen shooting-jacket, or
rather short frock, with a broad
leathern strap at the waist, loose
white trousers, and a foraging cap,
which he threw carelessly on the table
as he wiped his brow. Turning round
impatiently and with some haughtiness
from his companion, he surveyed
me with a quick observant flash of his
piercing eyes, and then stretched himself
at length on the bench, and appeared
either to doze or muse, till, in
obedience to his companion's orders,
the board was spread with all the cold
meats the larder could supply.</p>

<p>"Beef!" said his companion, screwing
a pinchbeck glass into his right
eye. "Beef;&mdash;mottled, cowey&mdash;humph.
Lamb;&mdash;oldish&mdash;rawish&mdash;muttony,
humph. Pie;&mdash;stalish,
veal?&mdash;no, pork. Ah! what will
you have?"</p>

<p>"Help yourself," replied the young
man peevishly, as he sat up, looked
disdainfully at the viands, and after a
long pause, tasted first one, then the
other, with many shrugs of the shoulders
and muttered exclamations of discontent.
Suddenly he looked up and
called for brandy; and to my surprise,
and I fear admiration, he drank nearly
half a tumblerful of that poison undiluted,
with a composure that spoke
of habitual use.</p>

<p>"Wrong!" said his companion,
drawing the bottle to himself, and
mixing the alcohol in careful proportions
with water. "Wrong! coats
of stomach soon wear out, with that
kind of clothes' brush. Better stick
to 'the yeasty foam' as sweet Will
says. That young gentleman sets you
a good example," and therewith the
speaker nodded at me familiarly. Inexperienced
as I was, I surmised at
once that it was his intention to make
acquaintance with the neighbour thus
saluted. I was not deceived. "Any
thing to tempt <em>you</em>, sir?" asked this
social personage after a short pause,
and describing a semicircle with the
point of his knife.</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir, but I have dined."</p>

<p>"What then? 'Break out into a
second course of mischief,' as the swan
recommends&mdash;swan of Avon, sir!
No? 'Well then, I charge you with
this cup of sack.' Are you going far, if
I may take the liberty to ask?"</p>

<p>"To London, when I can get there!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the traveller&mdash;while
his young companion lifted his
eyes; and I was again struck with
their remarkable penetration and
brilliancy.</p>

<p>"London is the best place in the
world for a lad of spirit. See life
there; 'glass of fashion and mould
of form.' Fond of the play, sir?"</p>

<p>"I never saw one!"</p>

<p>"Possible!" cried the gentleman,
dropping the handle of his knife, and
bringing up the point horizontally:
"then, young man," he added solemnly,
"you have, but I won't say what
you have to see. I won't say&mdash;no, not
if you could cover this table with
golden guineas, and exclaim with the
generous ardour so engaging in youth
'Mr Peacock, these are yours, if you
will only say what I have to see!'"</p>

<p>I laughed outright&mdash;may I be forgiven
for the boast, but I had the reputation
at school of a pleasant laugh.
The young man's face grew dark at
the sound: he pushed back his plate
and sighed.</p>

<p>"Why," continued his friend, "my
companion here, who I suppose is
about your own age, <em>he</em> could tell you
what a play is! he could tell you what
life is. He has viewed the manners
of the town: 'perused the traders,'
as the swan poetically remarks.
Have you not, my lad, eh?"</p>

<p>Thus directly appealed to, the boy
looked up with a smile of scorn on
his lips. "Yes, I know what life is,
and I say that life, like poverty, has
strange bedfellows. Ask me what
life is now, and I say a melodrama;
ask me what it is twenty years hence,
and I shall say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A farce?" put in his comrade.</p>

<p>"No, a tragedy&mdash;or comedy as
Congreve wrote it."</p>

<p>"And how is that?" I asked, interested
and somewhat surprised at the
tone of my contemporary.</p>

<p>"Where the play ends in the triumph
of the wittiest rogue. My friend hee
has no chance!"</p>

<p>"'Praise from Sir Hubert Stanley,'
hem&mdash;yes&mdash;Hal Peacock maybe witty,
but he is no rogue."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was not exactly my meaning,"
said the boy dryly.</p>

<p>"'A fico for your meaning,'" as the
swan says. "Hallo, you, sir! Bully
Host, clear the table, fresh tumblers&mdash;hot
water&mdash;sugar&mdash;lemon, and the
bottle's out! Smoke, sir?" and Mr
Peacock offered me a cigar.</p>

<p>Upon my refusal, he carefully
twirled round a very uninviting specimen
of some fabulous havannah&mdash;moistened
it all over, as a boa-constrictor
may do the ox he prepares
for deglutition; bit off one end, and
lighting the other from a little machine
for that purpose which he drew from
his pocket, he was soon absorbed in
a vigorous effort (which the damp
inherent in the weed long resisted)
to poison the surrounding atmosphere.
Therewith, the young gentleman,
either from emulation or in self-defence,
extracted from his own pouch
a cigar-case of notable elegance, being
of velvet, embroidered apparently by
some fair hand, for "From Juliet"
was very legibly worked thereon&mdash;selected
a cigar of better appearance
than that in favour with his comrade,
and seemed quite as familiar with the
tobacco as he had been with the
brandy.</p>

<p>"Fast, sir&mdash;fast lad that!" quoth
Mr Peacock, in the short gasps which
his resolute struggle with his uninviting
victim alone permitted&mdash;"nothing
but&mdash;(puff, puff)&mdash;your true&mdash;(suck&mdash;suck,)
syl&mdash;syl&mdash;sylva&mdash;does
for him. Out, by the Lord! 'the jaws
of darkness have devoured it up;'" and
again Mr Peacock applied to his phosphoric
machine. This time patience
and perseverance succeeded, and the
heart of the cigar responded by a dull
red spark (leaving the sides wholly
untouched) to the indefatigable
ardour of its wooer.</p>

<p>This feat accomplished, Mr Peacock
exclaimed triumphantly, "And now
what say you, my lads, to a game at
cards?&mdash;three of us&mdash;whist and a
dummy?&mdash;nothing better&mdash;eh?" As
he spoke, he produced from his coat-pocket
a red silk handkerchief, a
bunch of keys, a nightcap, a toothbrush,
a piece of shaving-soap, four
lumps of sugar, the remains of a bun,
a razor, and a pack of cards. Selecting
the last, and returning its motley
accompaniments to the abyss whence
they had emerged, he turned up, with
a jerk of his thumb and finger, the
knave of clubs, and, placing it on the
top of the rest, slapped the cards emphatically
on the table.</p>

<p>"You are very good, but I don't
know whist," said I.</p>

<p>"Not know whist&mdash;not been to a
play! not smoke! Then pray tell me,
young man," (said he majestically, and
with a frown,) "what on earth you <em>do</em>
know!"</p>

<p>Much consternated by this direct
appeal, and greatly ashamed of my
ignorance of the cardinal points of
erudition in Mr Peacock's estimation,
I hung my head, and looked down.</p>

<p>"That is right," renewed Mr Peacock,
more benignly; "you have the
ingenuous shame of youth. It is promising,
sir&mdash;'lowliness is young ambition's
ladder,' as the swan says.
Mount the first step, and learn whist&mdash;sixpenny
points to begin with."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my newness in
actual life, I had had the good fortune
to learn a little of the way before me,
by those much-slandered guides called
novels&mdash;works which are often to the
inner world what maps are to the
outer; and sundry recollections of
"Gil Blas" and the "Vicar of Wakefield"
came athwart me. I had no
wish to emulate the worthy Moses,
and felt that I might not have even
the shagreen spectacles to boast of, in
my negotiations with this new Mr
Jenkinson. Accordingly, shaking my
head, I called for my bill. As I took
out my purse&mdash;knit by my mother&mdash;with
one gold piece in one corner, and
sundry silver ones in the other, I saw
that the eyes of Mr Peacock twinkled.</p>

<p>"Poor spirit, sir! poor spirit, young
man! 'This avarice sticks deep,'
as the swan beautifully observes.
'Nothing venture, nothing have.'"</p>

<p>"Nothing have, nothing venture,"
I returned, plucking up spirit.</p>

<p>"Nothing have!&mdash;Young sir, do
you doubt my solidity&mdash;my capital&mdash;my
'golden joys?'"</p>

<p>"Sir, I spoke of myself. I am not
rich enough to gamble."</p>

<p>"Gamble!" exclaimed Mr Peacock,
in virtuous indignation&mdash;"Gamble!
what do you mean, sir? You insult
me!" and he rose threateningly, and
slapped his white hat on his wig.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! let him alone, Hal,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
said the boy contemptuously. "Sir,
if he is impertinent, thrash him."
(This was to me.)</p>

<p>"Impertinent!&mdash;thrash!" exclaimed
Mr Peacock, waxing very red; but
catching the sneer on his companion's
lip, he sat down, and subsided into
sullen silence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I paid my bill. This
duty, rarely a cheerful one, performed,
I looked round for my knapsack, and
perceived that it was in the boy's
hands. He was very coolly reading
the address which, in case of accidents,
I had prudently placed on it&mdash;Pisistratus
Caxton, Esq., &mdash;&mdash; Hotel,
&mdash;&mdash; Street, &mdash;, Strand.</p>

<p>I took my knapsack from him, more
surprised at such a breach of good
manners in a young gentleman who
knew life so well, than I should have
been at a similar error on the part of
Mr Peacock. He made no apology,
but nodded farewell, and stretched
himself at full length on the bench.
Mr Peacock, now absorbed in a game
of patience, vouchsafed no return to
my parting salutation, and in another
moment I was alone on the high-road.
My thoughts turned long upon the
young man I had left: mixed with a
sort of instinctive compassionate foreboding
of an ill future for one with
such habits, and in such companionship,
I felt an involuntary admiration,
less even for his good looks
than his ease, audacity, and the careless
superiority he assumed over a
comrade so much older than himself.</p>

<p>The day was far gone when I saw
the spires of a town at which I intended
to rest for the night. The
horn of a coach behind made me
turn my head, and, as the vehicle
passed me, I saw on the outside Mr
Peacock, still struggling with a cigar&mdash;it
could scarcely be the same&mdash;and
his young friend stretched on the roof
amongst the luggage, leaning his
handsome head on his hand, and
apparently unobservant both of me
and every one else.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p>I am apt&mdash;judging egotistically, perhaps,
from my own experience&mdash;to
measure a young man's chances of
what is termed practical success in
life, by what may seem at first two
very vulgar qualities; viz., his inquisitiveness
and his animal vivacity. A
curiosity which springs forward to
examine every thing new to his information&mdash;a
nervous activity, approaching
to restlessness, which rarely
allows bodily fatigue to interfere with
some object in view&mdash;constitute, in
my mind, very profitable stock in
hand to begin the world with.</p>

<p>Tired as I was, after I had performed
my ablutions, and refreshed
myself in the little coffee-room of the
inn at which I put up, with the pedestrian's
best beverage, familiar and
oft-calumniated tea, I could not resist
the temptation of the broad bustling
street, which, lighted with gas, shone
on me through the dim windows of
the coffee-room. I had never before
seen a large town, and the contrast of
lamp-lit, busy night in the streets,
with sober, deserted night in the lanes
and fields, struck me forcibly.</p>

<p>I sauntered out, therefore, jostling
and jostled, now gazing at the windows,
now hurried along the tide of
life, till I found myself before a cook'
shop, round which clustered a small
knot of housewives, citizens, and
hungry-looking children. While contemplating
this group, and marvelling
how it comes to pass that the staple
business of earth's majority is how,
when, and where to eat, my ear was
struck with "'In Troy there lies the
scene,' as the illustrious Will remarks."</p>


<p>Looking round, I perceived Mr Peacock
pointing his stick towards an open
doorway next to the cook's shop,
the hall beyond which was lighted
with gas, while, painted in black letters
on a pane of glass over the door,
was the word "Billiards."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, the
speaker plunged at once into the aperture
and vanished. The boy-copanion
was following more slowly,
when his eye caught mine. A slight
blush came over his dark cheek; he
stopped, and leaning against the door-jambs,
gazed on me hard and long
before he said&mdash;"Well met again,
sir! You find it hard to amuse yourself
in this dull place; the nights are
long out of London."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," said I, ingenuously, "every
thing here amuses me; the lights, the
shops, the crowd; but, then, to me
every thing is new."</p>

<p>The youth came from his lounging-place
and moved on, as if inviting me
to walk; while he answered, rather
with bitter sullenness, than the melancholy
his words expressed&mdash;</p>

<p>"One thing, at least, cannot be new
to you; it is an old truth with us
before we leave the nursery&mdash;'Whatever
is worth having must be bought;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</i>, he who cannot buy, has nothing
worth having.'"</p>

<p>"I don't think," said I, wisely,
"that the things best worth having
can be bought at all. You see that
poor dropsical jeweller standing before
his shop-door,&mdash;his shop is the finest
in the street,&mdash;and I dare say he would
be very glad to give it to you or me in
return for our good health and strong
legs. Oh no! I think with my father&mdash;'All
that are worth having are given
to all;&mdash;that is, nature and labour.'"</p>

<p>"Your father says that; and you
go by what your father says! Of
course, all fathers have preached that,
and many other good doctrines, since
Adam preached to Cain; but I don't
see that the fathers have found their
sons very credulous listeners."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for the sons,"
said I bluntly.</p>

<p>"Nature," continued my new acquaintance,
without attending to my
ejaculation&mdash;"nature indeed does give
us much, and nature also orders each
of us how to use her gifts. If nature
gave you the propensity to drudge,
you will drudge; if she gives me the
ambition to rise, and the contempt
for work, I may rise&mdash;but I certainly
shall not work."</p>

<p>"Oh," said I, "you agree with
Squills, I suppose, and fancy we are
all guided by the bumps on our foreheads?"</p>

<p>"And the blood in our veins, and
our mother's milk. We inherit other
things besides gout and consumption.
So you always do as your father tells
you! Good boy!"</p>

<p>I was piqued. Why we should
be ashamed of being taunted for
goodness, I never could understand;
but certainly I felt humbled.
However I answered sturdily&mdash;"If
you had as good a father as I have,
you would not think it so very extraordinary
to do as he tells you."</p>

<p>"Ah! so he is a very good father,
is he! He must have a great trust
in your sobriety and steadiness to let
you wander about the world as he
does."</p>

<p>"I am going to join him in London."</p>

<p>"In London! Oh, does he live
there?"</p>

<p>"He is going to live there for some
time."</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, we may meet. I,
too, am going to town."</p>

<p>"Oh, we shall be sure to meet
there!" said I, with frank gladness;
for my interest in the young man was
not diminished by his conversation,
however much I disliked the sentiments
it expressed.</p>

<p>The lad laughed, and his laugh was
peculiar. It was low, musical, but
hollow and artificial.</p>

<p>"Sure to meet! London is a large
place: where shall you be found?"</p>

<p>I gave him, without scruple, the
address of the hotel at which I expected
to find my father; although his
deliberate inspection of my knapsack
must already have apprised him of that
address. He listened attentively, and
repeated it twice over, as if to impress
it on his memory; and we both
walked on in silence, till, turning up
a small passage, we suddenly found
ourselves in a large churchyard,&mdash;a
flagged path stretched diagonally
across it towards the market-place,
on which it bordered. In this churchyard,
upon a grave-stone, sat a
young Savoyard; his hurdy-gurdy, or
whatever else his instrument might be
called, was on his lap; and he was
gnawing his crust, and feeding some
poor little white mice (standing on
their hind-legs on the hurdy-gurdy)
as merrily as if he had chosen the
gayest resting-place in the world.</p>

<p>We both stopped. The Savoyard,
seeing us, put his arch head on one
side, showed all his white teeth in
that happy smile so peculiar to his
race, and in which poverty seems to
beg so blithely, and gave the handle
of his instrument a turn.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" said I.</p>

<p>"Aha, you pity him! but why?
According to your rule, Mr Caxton,
he is not so much to be pitied; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
dropsical jeweller would give him as
much for his limbs and health as for
ours! How is it&mdash;answer me, son of
so wise a father&mdash;that no one pities
the dropsical jeweller, and all pity
the healthy Savoyard? It is, sir,
because there is a stern truth which
is stronger than all Spartan lessons&mdash;Poverty
<em>is</em> the master-ill of the world.
Look round. Does poverty leave its
signs over the graves? Look at that
large tomb fenced round; read that
long inscription:&mdash;'virtues'&mdash;'best of
husbands'&mdash;'affectionate father'&mdash;'inconsolable
grief'&mdash;'sleeps in the
joyful hope,' &amp;c., &amp;c. Do you suppose
these stoneless mounds hide no
dust of what were men just as good?
But no epitaph tells their virtues;
bespeaks their wives' grief; or promises
joyful hope to them!"</p>

<p>"Does it matter? Does God care
for the epitaph and tombstone?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Date qualche cosa!</i>" said the
Savoyard, in his touching patois, still
smiling, and holding out his little
hand.</p>

<p>Therein I dropped a small coin.
The boy evinced his gratitude by a
new turn of the hurdy-gurdy.</p>

<p>"That is not labour," said my companion;
"and had you found him at
work, you had given him nothing. I
too have my instrument to play upon
and my mice to see after. Adieu!"</p>

<p>He waved his hand, and strode irreverently
over the graves back in the
direction we had come.</p>

<p>I stood before the fine tomb with
its fine epitaph; the Savoyard looked
at me wistfully.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p>The Savoyard looked at me wistfully.
I wished to enter into conversation
with him. That was not easy.
However, I began:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;"You must be often
hungry enough, my poor boy. Do the
mice feed you?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Savoyard</span> puts his head on one
side, shakes it, and stroked his mice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus.</span>&mdash;"You are very
fond of the mice; they are your only
friends, I fear."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Savoyard</span>, evidently understanding
Pisistratus, rubs his face gently
against the mice, then puts them softly
down on a grave, and gives a turn to
the hurdy-gurdy. The mice play unconcernedly
over the grave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, pointing first to the
beasts, then to the instrument.&mdash;"Which
do you like best, the mice or
the hurdy-gurdy?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Savoyard</span> shows his teeth&mdash;considers&mdash;stretches
himself on the grass&mdash;plays
with the mice&mdash;and answers
volubly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, by the help of Latin
comprehending that the Savoyard
says, that the mice are alive and the
hurdy-gurdy is not&mdash;"Yes, a live
friend is better than a dead one.
Mortua est hurda-gurda!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Savoyard</span> shakes his head vehemently.&mdash;"Nô&mdash;nô!
Eccellenza, non
ê mortu!" and strikes up a lively air
on the slandered instrument. The
Savoyard's face brightens&mdash;he looks
happy: the mice run from the grave
into his bosom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span>, affected.&mdash;"Have you
a father&mdash;An vivat pater?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Savoyard</span>, with his face overcast.&mdash;"Nô&mdash;eccellenza!"
then pausing a
little, he says briskly, "Si-Si!" and
plays a solemn air on the hurdy-gurdy&mdash;stops&mdash;rests
one hand on the
instrument, and raises the other to
heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pisistratus</span> understands.&mdash;"The
father is like the hurdy-gurdy, at once
dead and living. The mere form is a
dead thing, but the music lives."
Pisistratus drops another small piece
of silver on the ground, and turns
away.</p>

<p>"God help and God bless thee,
Savoyard. Thou hast done Pisistratus
all the good in the world. Thou
hast corrected the hard wisdom of
the young gentleman in the velveteen
jacket; Pisistratus is a better lad for
having stopped to listen to thee."</p>

<p>I regained the entrance to the
churchyard&mdash;I looked back&mdash;there
sate the Savoyard, still amidst men's
graves, but under God's sky. He was
still looking at me wistfully, and when
he caught my eye, he pressed his hand
to his heart, and smiled. "God help
and God bless thee, young Savoyard."</p>

<h2>REPUBLICAN FRANCE.</h2>

<h3>JUNE 1848.</h3>


<p>How far is the application to France,
of the epithet employed in the title
that heads these pages, a misnomer?
This is a question that would be answered
very differently by those who
study its state of feeling, and those
who judge its position by mere established
fact. That the fact and the
feeling are completely at issue throughout
the country, is undoubted, indisputable.
A republican government
has been established by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de
main</i> of a small minority in France&mdash;has
been accepted by the hesitation of
surprise&mdash;has been maintained by the
desire of peace and order:&mdash;so far goes
fact. Republican principles were
hateful to the immense majority of
the country at large in the past, uncongenial
to its habits and sentiments,
impossible according to its views; they
are productive, as yet, of nothing but
confusion, distress, ruin, riot, and
mistrust, in the present; they are
looked upon with alarm as regards
their results in the future:&mdash;so much
for feeling. Fact and feeling, then,
are at variance and in collision. The
result of the conflict lies hidden in the
mysteries of that future, the issue of
which, at no epoch of history, perhaps,
clearseeing eyes and wise foreseeing
heads could less pretend to predict,
than in the present chaotic hurly-burly
of European society. The politicians
who declared that the general
spirit of the country in France was, in
their vague and fantastic language of
the Chamber, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">centre-gauche</i>, or the
advocate of liberal progress, may have
been very right,&mdash;but republican it
never was, republican it is not. Republican&mdash;without
pretension to the
audacity of a prediction but just
stated as impossible&mdash;it certainly does
not as yet appear ever likely to become.</p>

<p>In its present state of feeling, then,
France&mdash;that is to say, the country,
the provinces, the departments, or
whatever France, out of Paris, may
be called&mdash;is about as much genuine
republican, as a white man who suddenly
finds his face smeared over with
the contents of a blacking-bottle is a
genuine negro. But, for the sake of
avoiding that confusion of terms and
ideas in which the French themselves
are so fond of indulging, to an extent
that proves the deification of "the
vague" to take far higher flights among
them, especially in their republican
tenets, than any flown by confused
German head,&mdash;let it be taken as a
rule, that fact is to have the precedence
of feeling, as in most matters in
the world,&mdash;and let it be supposed that
the misnomer is no misnomer, that
there has been no mistake, in truth, in
the title of "Republican France."</p>

<p>Between France out of Paris and
France in Paris, a great distinction,
in speaking of the country, must always
be drawn; although, in the
matter of republicanism in the feelings
of the mass, the same blacking-bottle
remark might be applied to the
majority of the citizens of the capital,
as to the country at large. No family
of grown-up daughters, who have been
tyrannically kept in the nursery like
children when they no longer felt
themselves such, and made to wear
mamma's worn-out dresses scantily
cut down to their shapes, could be
more sundered in feeling from their
lady-mother, and jealous of her overgrown
charms, her gaiety, her splendour,
and her power, than the
departments,&mdash;kept in the nursery
upon centralisation system, and
fed upon the bread-and-milk of
insignificance,&mdash;are of the tyrannical
supremacy, the overweening superiority,
and the disdainful airs, affected
to her despised progeny
by Mother Paris. The pursuance of
the concentrating system has thus
produced an estrangement in the
family,&mdash;a jealousy and spite on the
one hand, a greater and increasing
assumption of airs of supremacy on
the other. The family ties between
Paris and France are as wholly disunited
as family ties can be, in the
necessities of a more or less intimate
connexion: the mother has isolated,
in her despotism, herself from her children,
the children have imbibed distrust
and envy of the mother. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
consequence is, that there are two
distinct families in feeling,&mdash;there
are two Frances; there is the France
of Paris, of Paris that asserts its
right to be all France, and the France
of the departments, that, in spite
of the assertions of Paris, desire
to put in their little claim for a
small share in the name, and would
like to have their own little fingers in
the pies of revolutions, and changes of
government in the family, that mamma
cooks up. True, they are supposed
to eat at the same table, but mamma
has all the tit-bits. They have a voice
in the family council, but it is when
mamma has already issued her <em>dictum</em>,
and declared that such and such things
shall be as she has decided it. They
help to support the family establishment
with the moneys which mamma
declares they must contribute out
of their heritage; but then mamma,
they declare, spends a most undue
proportion upon herself, in dressing
herself out with finery, keeping up an
unnecessary state, and throwing away
the sums confided to her to overpay
a throng of unruly onhangers, with all
the prodigality of fear; while they, the
poor daughters, are made to put up
with cast-off finery, and to be thwarted
and twitted by harsh governesses,
and to fight, as best they may, with
an obstreperous herd of unpaid pensioners,
which mamma's mismanagement
has excited to uproar; and then,
after all, to kiss hands and thank
mamma for whatever they can get,&mdash;scanty
sugar-plums and many cuffs.
Is this to be endured? The children
grumble much, and particularly since
mamma has chosen to make changes
in the direction of the household
establishment of which they by no
means approve, and has only produced
confusion and disorder in it. But at
present they can do no more than
grumble; mamma has the rod, and
they know that she will use it;
mamma has the supreme influence,
and habit makes them think they
must abide by it. There is no doubt,
at the same time, that the children
and parent would unite in a common
bond of union were the family honour
to be asserted against an attack from
any adversary to the family out of
the house. Their intestine jealousies
would be forgotten for the time, for
the maintenance of the common
good&mdash;a fancied good; for, after
all, mother and daughters have
the same blood, the same temperr
and character, the same vain-glory,
conceit, and irritability, the same
strong prejudices of ignorance; and
they would join hands and clamour
together in the same opposition to the
stranger. But this common-cause
making, upon occasions of extraordinary
pressure from without, detracts
nothing, at other times, from the mistrust,
jealousy, and angry susceptibility
of the children in internal affairs.
In moments of family crisis, will
matters always go on as heretofore?</p>

<p>Nurseries will be obstreperous sometimes,
and children will revolt, and
mammas may pass very uncomfortable
moments in the face of angry
daughters in rebellion. Will the
children take upon themselves, at
last, to protest against mamma's disdainful
commands, and assert a will
of their own, and a right to think for
themselves? This question is one
upon the solution of which depends
the fate of France, as well as upon the
many thousand chances which the
capricious and ever-shifting gales of
a revolutionary atmosphere may, at
any moment, suddenly blow, like a
spark into a powder barrel, shattering
the face of the past, and changing
the direction of the future. Twice
already, since the revolution of February,
has the question been nearly
answered in the affirmative. The
last instance, of which more anon,
may be taken as a striking proof
that the children may possibly not
always submit to the dictates of
the mother,&mdash;that family mistrust
may break out into family quarrel,
and family quarrel in nations is
civil war. Who again, however,
may venture to predict what shall be
the destinies of Republican France,&mdash;what
web of darkness or of light, of
blood-streaked stuff or of gold-threaded
tissue, it may be weaving
with its agitated and troubled hands,
or what force it may interpose to
tear the work to shreds before
it be even yet completed? Most
may fear, none may say. But prediction,
upon whatever cunning foresight
it may be based, must always
call a sort of feeling of inspiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
nearly allied to superstition, to its
aid: and thus the fanciful mind may,
without taking upon itself the airs of
a Pythoness, give way to a little superstition,
and yet, perhaps, be not too
strongly condemned of folly. There exists
an old prophecy in France, emanating
from a monk of the middle ages,
the authenticity of which cannot be
doubted, or, at all events, cannot be
disputed, in as far as it was in well-known
existence at the commencement
of this century. It predicts, in
mystic language,&mdash;dark, it is true, but
wonderfully clear after its verification,&mdash;all
the many revolutionary changes
that have taken place in France, and
now once more proclaims the reign
of the "sons of Brutus." "Armed
men," it distinctly says, "will march
upon the doomed city," "sword and
fire will prevail against it," "the
wolves will devour each other." May
the seeming superstition of a fantastical
question be pardoned! May not
these words refer to the future outbreak
of the provinces of France
against the capital? If they do, in
what sense, with what tendencies, to
forward the views of what party, may
it be? Be that as it may, however,
it is not the obscure future that is
dealt with here, but the present confused
and uncertain state of Republican
France.</p>

<p>As it may be inferred from what has
been said, Paris, then, has put on its
crown, as capital, to some purpose.
Never did despot assert his right to
dictate his autocratic will to serfs and
slaves more authoritatively than does
revolutionary and republican Paris
to the provinces of France. No
three-tailed Bashaw of old melodrams
could be more imperative in
his ordinances, more arrogant in
the conviction of the indisputability
of his will. The bare supposition
that the provinces could have a will
of their own would strike Paris dumb
with astonishment. Paris has been
accustomed to consider itself not only
as the heart, but the head, and the
arms and legs to boot, of the whole
country. The inert body has no more,
in its consideration, to do, than allow
itself to be fed with what scanty morsels
of bounty and importance Paris
may choose to afford, and then not to
dare to grumble afterwards if the food
prove unsavoury to its tastes, or indigestible
to its susceptibilities. Paris
is "Sir Oracle," and, when it speaks,
no provincial "dog dare bark."
Paris, thus, is the great type of
the mainspring of the national character,&mdash;which
works sometimes,
we allow, for good as well as for
evil:&mdash;namely, of that mixture of
vanity and overweening conceit, which
may be found at the bottom of almost
every action of the French. It calls
itself "the great capital of the
civilised world;" and thus considers
that, although the departments may be
admitted to the reflected rays of lustre
that emanate from its superior glory,
they must look upon themselves as
mere satellites, created to revolve at its
liking and its high will, and perform
their revolutions in whatever direction
it deems fit to make its own revolution.
Let it not be supposed that this
representation is exaggerated, or that
it proceeds from the distorted views
of a foreigner. Hear the Parisian himself
speak; list to his expressions of
contempt for those unknown and barbarous
regions called departments;
mark how he asserts the unutterable
superiority of his Parisian essence;
see how he tosses his head and curls
his lip with an infinitely aristocratic air,
when he condescends to notice them
with a word; and never was Paris more
eager in the maintenance of its tyrannical
supremacy; never was it more
despotically and autocratically disposed;
never more aristocratic, to use
the pet phrase of the day, than under
the rule of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> liberty, and of
liberty of opinion, above all other
liberties proclaimed by the French
republic.</p>

<p>What were the expressions of the
first republican minister of the interior,
that type of republican exclusiveness
and despotism, in his famous and
rather too famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bulletins de la republique</i>,
issued to all France as the
language and opinions of the government
of the day? Paris, they informed
the world, was the heart of France,
from which all life and living principle
emanated, through which every drop
of the country's blood must flow, in
order that it might beat in unison, and
be refreshed with true republican
vitality. Paris, they said again, was
the hand that had created and fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the republic, and that was to direct its
steps, lead it vigorously forward in its
way&mdash;as it was the head that conceived,
it was the hand that executed: it
was more than all this, it was the <em>soul</em>
of France&mdash;the pure and true essence
emanating from the new deity, the republic.
Paris, they asserted in as
many direct words, was the mistress
whose will was to be obeyed. It is
unnecessary to point out how little
such declarations were in accordance
with republican principles, what little
affinity they had with the three great
watchwords of the day, "Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity." Republicanism
in France, according to those
old traditions, to which those who call
themselves the only true and pure republicans
seem always to be looking
back as the only true and pure models
for their admiration and imitation,
was always based upon despotism,
supported by constraint, compulsion,
violence, and even terrorism; and the
first efforts of modern republicanism
were evidently exerted to place their
old, newfangled, statue of bastard
liberty upon the same heterogeneous
pedestal. The instructions of the same
Bashaw-minister to the emissaries
whom he despatched as Bashaws of
lesser and fewer tails into the provinces,
to see that they were duly disposed to
fall down and worship the Goddess Republic,
that had been set up, were
modelled after the same and still
rougher fashion.</p>

<p>The missionaries were invested with
autocratic powers to make and unmake
according to their own autocratic will;
to send away functionaries who might
appear lukewarm in the cause; to put
in their places such acolytes as might
better serve the altars of the goddess,
and to offer up sacrifices to her, civil
and military, judicial and political, as
they might think pleasing to the divinity,
or convenient and agreeable to
their own hates and prejudices. They
were particularly requested to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">travailler</i>
the country, to torture it, as the
French phrase goes; and were taught,
if they could not hammer the hard and
unbending metal of departmental
feeling to the shape they fancied, just
gently to make the iron red-hot with
the fire of terrorism, and then twist it
to the suitable form. How well the
workmen, in many instances, performed
the task&mdash;how well they employed
the fiery passions of the mob to
produce the desired red-hot effect, and
then strike&mdash;is a matter of historical
fact.</p>

<p>In the elections for the National
Assembly, the same dogmas of republican
religion were strenuously enforced.
No emissaries of the Inquisition
ever used more moral violence
to propagate a faith among suspected
schismatics, than did these ministers
of republican despotism to enforce the
full, entire, and uttermost doctrines of
their creed, even to the minutest
articles. Where the moral influence appeared
unlikely to penetrate as deeply
into men's hearts as was desired, other
and more direct methods were adopted
to make entire converts; and, when
these methods were found too mild to
work the intended effect, and purge the
land of moderatism and anti-whole-hog-ism,
another stronger and more
racking dose was administered: the
mob was excited to overawe with
threat and terrorism, and, where it
could not prevent, to destroy. How
should the departments dare to have a
will of their own? The rebellious
children were to be whipped like
schoolboys into learning their lessons
of pure and undefiled republicanism,
and reciting them as Master Commissioner
taught them; there was no
better rod in pickle for such naughty
urchins than the scourge of the fury
of a mob, carefully taught another
lesson, and one it was not slow of
learning&mdash;namely, that it was master,
and must constrain obedience to its
will; while, in fact, itself obeyed the
influence, and was the instrument of
the master-spirit that ruled up above,
and made the best, or rather the worst
use of its rule. That all these measures
failed in a great measure&mdash;those
of violence as well as those of moral
constraint&mdash;is attributable to a variety
of complicated reasons, connected with
the present state of the departments;
and the how and why they failed,
will be the subject of a few considerations
presently.</p>

<p>What, again, were the expressions
of the more violent and so-called only
true republican party in the capital,
proceeding from its organs, the clubs,
upon the same occasion of the elections?
To all the candidates who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
presented themselves before them, the
same question was propounded. If,
when the votes of all France were
taken, it should be found that the
departments declared themselves
averse to the establishment of a republic,
what would be the duty they
would have to perform,&mdash;what steps
would they take? Those who did not
declare that they would turn against
that National Assembly, of which
they themselves might then be members,
and take up arms to march upon
it, were denounced as traitors to their
country, unworthy of the votes of true
men, and hooted from the tribune, in
which they had dared to stand forward
as future representatives of the people.
It would have been in vain to insinuate
to these good gentlemen, that, in
the application of the principle of
universal suffrage, in which every man
was not only an elector, but eligible
as representative, the voice of the majority
would be the voice of all France;
and that it was for all France, by the
voice of its majority, to decide upon
the form of government best suited to
all France. In vain, indeed. The
ready answer would invariably have
been&mdash;that Paris was the mistress of
France, and had a right to dictate
its will; that Paris had made the
revolution, and that, consequently,
Paris was privileged to support the
principles of that revolution, and to
arrogate to itself all its advantages:
that the country at large, in fact, had
nothing to do but to give in its approval,
and be happy that its concurrence
was so far demanded, and that,
should it dare to have an opinion of
its own, woe betide it! All this insolent
bombast of the ultra party in
Paris might have been spared, however;
the cause of "Paris <em>v.</em> the Departments"
was never called into the
court of the country. The departments
had accepted the establishment of the
republic as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>: they never
desired to subvert the new order of
things by another convulsion, that
would have plunged the country, already
so miserable, into an increase of
misery; but they protested in favour
of a republic of peace and order, upon
moderate principles; and, lo and behold,
Paris itself combined with them
in this desire. The disappointed party
of the directing master-spirits of Paris
have been none the less furious in
their expressions of contempt for the
openly declared will of all France.
They had long kicked down their idol
of universal suffrage with disdain, as
soon as they had found that, in spite
of all the hidden machinery they had
set to work in it, the idol had not
obeyed their will, or declared their
oracles. Universal suffrage they pronounced
a hoax: constraint, tyranny,
anarchy, conspiracy, civil war, were
proclaimed by them the only true
elements of the only true republic.
Frantic with disappointment at the
result of their own manœuvres, by
which they had been caught in their
own toils, they seized upon the pretext
of sympathy in the sorrows of
another country; and, aided by the
treachery of certain of their own party
in authority, invaded the obnoxious
Assembly, overthrew the government
for an hour, and proclaimed a terrorist
government of their own. Foiled
again in this audacious attempt, <em>foiled
at least for the time being</em>, they now
endeavoured to patch up the shaking
soil that has given way beneath their
feet, and plunged their leaders into a
quagmire, and to build new foundations
for fresh aggressions upon the discontent
of a part of the working-classes.
For this purpose they have taken two
newfangled tools into their hands, the
one of impulsion, the other of repulsion&mdash;the
one of enthusiasm, the
other of alarm; and both are so
vaguely fashioned, and of so unintelligible
a nature, that the real
fact of their existence can never
be proved, although their use,
their purpose, and their design, in
the hands of these men, are very
clear. The one of these tools is a
bugbear, a phantom, a bogie, to which
they endeavour to give as terrific an
aspect as possible, in order to fright
ignorant men over into their own
ranks. This evil spirit, they declare,
has an existence, although no one
ever saw it, no one ever felt it, no one
ever knew where it dwells. No superstitious
people was ever endeavoured
to be worked up into a more irrefragable
belief of some mysterious
demon that haunts them in dark
woods and obscure places to devour
them&mdash;nor, generally, with more complete
success over the credulous; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
fear is the most powerful agent over
the minds of the masses, and more
especially when the fear is of the unknown
and mysterious: and certainly
no demon was ever described with a
more hideous or blacker face. This
bogie, phantom, bugbear, is a supposed
influence called "Reaction." No
precise form is given to it, for that
would be to deprive it of more than
half its terrors. No! <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">onme ignotum
pro terribili</i> is the policy. Nothing
can be more vague or indefinite than
this same monster, Reaction; it remains
an Ossianic cloudlike spectre,
floating no one knows whence, but
bringing death and pestilence in its
train. If the working-classes suffer,
it is the Reaction, they are told, that
is the cause of all their sufferings. If
all their exactions, however exorbitant
and impossible, <em>are not conceded
at once</em>, it is because that horrible Reaction
labours that their just demands
should be withheld. If the most violent
of their own body are not elected
as the true representatives of the
people, it is because that pestilential
Reaction has cast a spell over the
minds of all the electors. The Reaction
has also, potent demon although it be,
all the freaks and caprices of a lesser
imp; it performs the strangest and
most incomprehensible feats,&mdash;for if a
discontented mass of workmen revolt
unsuccessfully, and gain not their ends,
it was the Reaction again that was the
cause of all. The Reaction, for its own
vile reactionary purposes, it was, that
treacherously induced them to revolt,
when they themselves were naturally
inclined to be the most peaceable,
contented, and the least exorbitant
people on the earth. See how perfidious,
Machiavelic, and Jesuitical, is
this horrible monster Reaction! Pity
it is that, in order to establish the
fact of its real existence, it should not
as yet have made itself visible to
mortal eyes in any incarnate form!
The Reaction is, however, no less,
men are told, the enemy of the republic,
the adversary of all true republican
principles, labouring ever to overthrow
it; above all, the enemy of the people
and the people's interests, their undermining
serpent, their secret assassin.
It is already sapping, unseen, the foundations
of the republic, and it intends
to pull down the ruins of that august
structure upon the heads of the people,
and crush it for ever beneath them.
In spite of the infinite harm worked
upon the spirit of the lower classes by
the establishment of the belief in this
phantom, there would, perhaps, be
no real danger in the effect produced
by the clamours of insensate ultra
journals, the preachings of agitating
demagogues, and the insidious insinuations
of anarchist <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">meneurs</i> among the
crowd, did not certain members of the
government itself, and some of those
in authority, render themselves parties
concerned to the propagation of
the belief, either genuinely, from having
been themselves carefully inoculated
with the <em>virus</em> of false fear, until
they have really taken the disease, or
designedly, for the advancement of
their own purposes&mdash;did they not,
in fact, throw a sop continually to
mob-lecturers, by insinuating their
own conviction in the existence of
"bogie" by their decrees, edicts, and
proclamations, and, when they are
called to put down anarchy, never
obey without crying "Reaction" at
the same time, and vainly giving the
phantom a slap on the face. As it is&mdash;and
herein lies the evil&mdash;the people
are taught that the National Assembly,
as it is now constituted, is the
concentrated essence of the spirit of
Reaction&mdash;that the representatives of
the people, with but few exceptions,
are the ministering imps in a visible
form of the invisible demon. If a
word of reason is spoken in the Assembly
against the clamours of unreasonable
demand&mdash;"Look ye there! reaction!"
is the cry; if it prepares safe
measures of repression against the
open efforts of anarchy&mdash;"reaction;"
if it defends its own existence against
the subversive attempts of conspirators&mdash;"reaction;"
if it attempts to
establish the republic upon a firm
and solid, but moderate basis&mdash;"reaction;"
if it does any thing&mdash;"reaction;"
if it does nothing&mdash;"reaction;"
if it cannot perform impossible
wonders for the amelioration and prosperity
of the lower working-classes,&mdash;at
which, however, it labours most
hard,&mdash;"reaction&mdash;reaction&mdash;reaction;
the reaction of aristocratic feeling&mdash;the
reaction of ill will&mdash;the reaction
of indifference and indolence;" thereby
always meaning reaction against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
true republic, and its true representatives,
the lower classes. The phantom
Reaction is thus used as a tool by a
wild and violent party against the
present order of things; against the
moderate majority of the Assembly
more particularly; against all things
and all men not suiting its views, its
schemes, its dreams, and its ambitions;
and the bugbear is not ill got
up to scare the credulous of the lower
classes more completely into the toils
of the malcontents, with the fear that
reaction really may destroy that idol
from which they have been taught to
expect all the good gifts of "roasted
larks," for which they have only to
open their mouths, and "showers of
gold," for which they have only to
stretch forth their hands&mdash;that idol
that has been lacquered over with
the false gilding of delusive promises
by imprudent rulers, and
which the many still fancy to be
all of solid gold&mdash;in a word, the Republic.
The reaction, in truth, exists
not, or exists not in the manner that
people would be led to believe. If it
exists, it is in the disgust of the more
laborious and less tumultuous of the
lower classes themselves, who, in their
increasing misery, would be happy to
accept the Lama of Thibet, or any
other abstraction, with an absolute
government, in the place of the false
idol of their hopes, that has as yet
only deluded them into greater misery&mdash;
it is in the reactionary cry of the
wretched, who call for "King Log," or
any other senseless ruler that would
bring with it peace, and order, and a
hope of well-being.</p>

<p>The other tool employed by the
designing malcontents&mdash;that of impulsion&mdash;is
the banner upon which is inscribed
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Republique Democratique</i>."
We have a republic, it is true, they
say, but not the republic of our wishes.
This is only a mere republic like
any other: we want a democratic republic,
and the democratic republic is
taken from us; but the democratic
republic we must and will have. Ask
them what they mean by their "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">republique
democratique</i>," they will not
be able to inform you. They launch
into phrases which are but phrases:
they lose themselves in a cloudy confusion
of terms and ideas: they pretend
to give you vague and chaotic
explanations, that are no explanations
at all: they know not themselves
what they mean. Universal suffrage
upon its broadest basis, with all the
rights and privileges thereto attached,
in their most democratic sense, is no
democratic republic according to their
view. What is? Who can tell?&mdash;certainly
not they. "They have clamoured
for the moon," says a wit of
the day, "and the moon has been
given them; and now they cry, 'we
are betrayed; we wanted the sun,
and the sun we will have.' But have
a care! the sun will blind your eyes,
my friends, and you will stagger in
still greater darkness; the sun will
burn your fingers, and you will smart
beneath the blisters. But they heed
not; they still clamour for the sun." At
all events, the banner on which flaunts
aloft the words&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Republique démocratique</i>"
is a good rallying banner for
all malcontents, a good banner under
which to enlist the unwary among
their ranks. It is a cry, a clamour,
and all the more enticing because it
is vague, unexplained, mysterious in
its fresh promises of some fancied
good that has not yet arrived, full of
the great and alluring unknown. Thus
it serves a purpose.</p>

<p>But to return from this long digression
upon the efforts of subversive
parties, to the state of feeling that
subsists in Republican France between
its now well-sorted and divided elements&mdash;Paris
and the provinces.</p>

<p>What are, again, the expressions
used by the lower classes with regard
to the departments? what the
feelings they express? Ever the
same. Paris, they declare, makes, has
made, and will make all the revolutions
of the country. Paris, consequently,
is all in all in France: Paris
is the mistress, and the queen, the
supreme arbitress of the destinies of
France: Paris must be obeyed in all
its wishes and its high will. What
were the words of the workmen of the
national workshops, in a late revolt, to
the Minister of Public Works? They
were told that there was no longer
any work for them in the capital, that
their pretended labour was an irony
of labour, that the country paid them
for doing nothing, and that they were
eating the bread of idleness under the
name of work: they were told that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
they were to be dispersed in the provinces,
to be employed upon great
works of public utility&mdash;upon railroads
and canals, that stood still for
want of hands: while money was
lavishly promised them for this
work, which the treasury could
no longer afford upon unproductive
labour. What was their answer?
That they, the people, had made the
revolution in Paris, that they were
the masters of Paris, that Paris was
theirs, to work in it their work; that,
as masters of Paris, they were not to
be bid leave it; that leave it they
would not; that if labour failed, money
must be found them at all events,
or they would find means of taking it;
in short, that they would not be <em>degraded</em>
by being sent into the provinces.
The workmen of Paris claim,
then, to be the masters of the capital,
and still more, in their esteem, the
masters of all France. The people of
Paris, then, is <em>the</em> people; it owns no
other. Now the people, in modern
republican phrase, and alas! in government
decrees also, is by no means
the nation; it means the lower classes
alone. The people, it has been previously
declared, is the sovereign people,
whose voice is the voice of God; then,
they reply, by the simplest reasoning,
the sovereign people, whose voice is
the voice of God&mdash;it is alone we: it is
the lower classes. But there is still
another deduction to be drawn.
Among the lower classes it is only the
active, the stirring, the discontented,
the disorderly and tumultuous, who
come forward in evidence as the representatives
of this people. And
thus it is very clear that the sovereign
people, whose voice is the voice
of God, the sovereign of France, is a
small body of uneducated, misled, and
wrong-headed men in the capital. So
stands the account in theory. And
who can deny that, in theory, they are
in truth the masters? Who shall say
when the chances of revolutionary
struggles may not make them so in fact?</p>

<p>So stands the state of feeling on the
side of Paris&mdash;how stands it on the
other side?</p>

<p>When the revolution of February
broke out, the departments scarcely
knew themselves, their wishes, or
their feelings. They had no mutual
understanding. They were taken by
surprise. They had not the time to
consult their sentiments. Notoriously
anti-republican as has been shown to
have been the spirit of all France
in the departments, they accepted,
however, from old habit, the <em>dictum</em>
of Paris: they accepted, as has been
before remarked, from that species of
resignation shown in France to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait
accompli</i>: they accepted from a wish
to avoid all further convulsion, from
a love of established order in whatever
shape it might come&mdash;from a hope
that, whatever the form of government
proclaimed and imposed upon
the country, all would "go well."
And besides, the republic, they were
told, was only a provisional form of
government at a moment of crisis,
when no other could be adopted:
upon its future form of government,
the country, it was said, was to be
freely consulted: the provinces were
not prepared for the ulterior <em>dictum</em> of
Paris, that, without consulting the
nation at all, the republic was to be
considered as definitive; and that those
who desired a change would be regarded
as traitors to their country.
But France is not what it was; it is
enlightened by the experience of
successive revolutions. The jealousy
of the departments, towards despotic
Paris had long been boiling in men's
hearts: it did not at first boil over;
but when, instead of order and peace,
the provinces found that the new
government produced only results of
disorder, animosity, and ruin, the
departments began to grumble and
murmur openly&mdash;for the first time
they seemed determined to show that
they ought to have, and would have, a
will of their own. In the commencement
all was tranquil. In some parts
of France the republic was accepted,
if not with that enthusiasm which
lying Parisian papers would have
induced the world to believe, at all
events with a species of contentment,
arising from the trust that a more
equitable popular government would
relieve the mass from some of those
charges which weighed so heavily
upon them under the former government,
and remove constraints that
were painful to them. In other parts,
there prevailed a sort of sullen resignation
to the establishment of a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> which was dreaded from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
experience of a hateful past, and was
repulsive to its tastes&mdash;but it was a
resignation to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>. Some
thus hoped, and others feared; but
all combined in assuming an attitude
of quiet expectation.</p>

<p>In this state was France, when an
imprudent Minister of the Interior,
pushed on by ambitious, designing,
misguided, and reckless men, sent
down as a scourge upon the country
those commissaries of obnoxious
memory, who were publicly charged
to work their will upon the departments
as they pleased, by the means
they pleased, by whatever oppressive
or repressive measures they pleased,
provided they worked the suspected
and mistrusted departments into a
proper feeling of true republican principle,
according to the most ultra
traditional doctrines of old republicanism.
Down upon the country
came the autocratic commissaries with
these instructions; and, in too many
instances, with the best intentions of
torturing and tormenting the country,
after their own fashion and according
to their own views, to their heart's
content. Down they came, with their
history of the first republic in their
heads, and the desire in their hearts
of emulating the zeal of those fearful
representatives of the people of the
last century, who ruled in the departments,
each a petty, but a bloody
tyrant. To all alike the same violence
of disposition must not be attributed:
there were a few more prudent and
better-thinking men among the number&mdash;although
they, in certain instances,
were afterwards accused in high
quarters of mild laxity, and recalled
as suspected of moderatism; but the
many were evidently disposed to play
the tyrant to the life, in their desperate
measures to twist the country to their
will. The times, however, were
changed; the spirit of the age no
longer permitted of the same violence.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs les Commissaires</i> could not
well proceed by the old-established
and expeditious method of cementing
the foundations of republics, one and
indivisible, by blood, or erecting the
scaffolding of the edifice on scaffolds.
Shootings, drownings, and guillotinings
were instruments rather too
rough to be accepted by the manners
of the time. But they had
other means in their power, and
according to the tenor of their instructions,
which they thought to use,
and attempted to use, with just as
much effect. They dismissed functionaries
in wholesale numbers&mdash;put their
creatures, or those who cringed and worshipped,
in their places, with orders to
brow-beat and bully the recalcitrant,
and with the exhibition of high
example before their eyes. They
threatened and accused; and when
these means failed, according to their
fancy, or when they were too mild
for the taste of Master Commissary,
the other underhand instruments of
terrorism, already mentioned, were
employed to make men crouch and
tremble. The manner in which mobs
have been excited against the better
classes, or those who were suspected
of moderatism, by manœuvres unequivocally
traced to the agency of the
commissaries themselves, and the
frightful excesses committed, are
matters of common notoriety and of
newspaper history. The scenes of
the old Revolution were resorted to,
although in another form; and not
only supposed anti-republican sentiment,
but moderatism, was endeavoured
to be kept down by agents of
terror, and the ever-ready riotous
populations of the great towns. It
would be an endless and a useless task
to re-transcribe all the scenes of the
violence of an insensate mob, secretly
got up by the republican agents in
authority, more than secretly connived
at, and openly and avowedly excused
and applauded. The rod that the commissary
himself could not prudently
employ, he placed in the hands of a
designedly inflamed and infuriated
people, to scourge the country to his
will. One of the strongest instances,
however, may be found in that state
of continual terror on the one hand, and
violence on the other, which for
many long weeks hung over the head
of the doomed city of Lyons. See
there the mob constituting itself into
illegally armed bodies, sundered from
and inimical to the national guards,
assuming names, such as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les voraces</i>
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les dévorants</i>, by which they
themselves marked their character,
ruling the whole city of Lyons by fear;
exacting, spoliating, arresting
<em>suspects</em> at will; searching the houses
of quiet inhabitants under the pretext
of conspiracies against the republic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that did not exist, and of concealed
arms, such as they themselves illegally
bore, that never could be found;
dragging trembling priests from the
altar to be confined in cellars, because
they were suspected of anti-republicanism;
laying their hands upon
church plate as the property of traitors;
liberating prisoners arrested for
revolt and disorder&mdash;arresting the
magistrates who had condemned
them; dictating their orders to military
officers for the release of soldiers
put under restraint; pulling a general
from his horse, and nearly immolating
him to the wrath of their high justice
in the streets; commanding the fortresses,
making barricades at the least
opposition to their will, domineering
over the whole city as masters&mdash;a herd
of power-intoxicated savages&mdash;and the
commissary looking on, applauding,
sanctioning their deeds, rubbing his
hands with satisfaction, and approving
them with the words "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allez, mes
enfans! vous faites bien!</i>" Such scenes
as these, carried to the utmost limits
of anarchy and excess in Lyons, have
been exhibited also in almost all the
great towns of France, with all the
effect of well-applied terrorism. There
is scarcely one that has not similar
outrages, from the violence of an excited
mob, to lay to the charge of him
who was set in authority over them&mdash;to
work his will, so said the letter of
his instructions&mdash;but to preserve
peace and order, in a country where
convulsions, collisions, and commotions
were so infinitely to be dreaded
and avoided&mdash;so should his duty have
told him. It ought to be said, at the
same time, that the acknowledged
authorities of the government were
aided in their high revolutionary
mission, and in the extraordinary
means they employed in its execution,
by less acknowledged agents, in the
persons of emissaries from the violent
ultra clubs of Paris; who, arrogating
to themselves the right to the true
expression of the only true feeling of
Paris&mdash;and consequently, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à fortiori</i>, of
all France&mdash;racked the country with
their manœuvres, their excitements
to violence, their bullying threats and
intimidations. Unacknowledged by
government authority as they were,
however, their missions were bestowed
on them by the quondam friends and
fellow-conspirators, under the former
reign of the Minister of the Interior;
their expenses were supported by
funds, supplied no one could say by
what hand, although most might divine;
their measures were evidently
taken in accordance, and in perfectly
good understanding, with the departmental
commissary.</p>

<p>What, however, was the result?
The very reverse from that intended
by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs les Commissaires</i> and
their supporter, the Minister of the
Interior. They over-reached themselves,
and worked the very effect
they attempted to exterminate. Instead
of subjugating the departments
to their will of ultra-republicanism by
the violence of terrorism, they almost
roused the whole better feeling of the
country, at first quietly disposed and
resigned, against the very principles
of republicanism in general. The sentiment
at first accepted was soured
and embittered; the discontent and
aversion daily increased; and it was
more than once openly affirmed that
the departments were ready to revolt,
and formed the design of marching
upon Paris. That this subject was
actually discussed in large, and not
even secret meetings in the provinces&mdash;and
even in such as had been always
considered ultra-liberal and democratic
in their opinions, as parts of Normandy,
for instance&mdash;admits of but
little doubt; and this feeling, although
it was never actually embodied in any
living and active fact of resistance,
may be taken as one example in support
of the opinion, that the children
may not always prove so submissive
to the dictates of the mother, and may
one day raise their voices and hold
forth their hands to dispute her will.
The open and general outbreak of the
provinces, which was at one time expected,
and was the common topic of
conversation in Paris, was suppressed,
however, by the influence of the better-thinking
and more prudential men in
the country. But the feeling of opposition
and resistance did not fail to
manifest itself in minor demonstrations.
Expostulations were at first
made against the tyranny and the inflammatory
manœuvres of the government
commissaries; then broke out
angry remonstrances on the part of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, backed by the better and
quieter of the working-classes; and
at last, when all these more legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
means failed, the populations of several
of the larger towns rose against
the provisional despot, who played the
autocrat and the tyrant in the name of
"Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity."</p>

<p>The national guards took up arms
to demand the revocation and the departure
of the obnoxious commissary.
The commissary, in opposition, acted
the self-same part of which a despotic
king has since been so violently accused
by the republican journals. As Ferdinand
of Naples is said to have excited
the dregs of the populace, the
lazzaroni, to aid him in a reactionary
movement in his favour, so did even
the republican commissary after the
self-same system. He caused the mob
to be roused to his assistance, as to that
of the only true democratic friend of
the people; he called upon them to take
up arms and combat in his defence: the
lazzaroni mob of the departments was
the weapon he wielded to overcome the
resistance of the majority to his will.
In most instances the recalcitrant part
of the provincial populations prevailed.
In several of the larger towns, as in
Bordeaux, Bourges, and many others,
the commissary was obliged to take to
flight: in some the palace of the little
tyrant was stormed, he himself was
made prisoner, and was taken to the
railroad, and "packed off" back to
that Paris which had sent him. In a
very few instances only the influence
of the commissary gained the day: in
still less was he again returned, to be
enforced upon the department from
which he had been driven; and in one
case he was sent back by the powers
that were, only to be again ignominiously
expelled.</p>

<p>In the department of the Ariège, at
the town of Foix, a journal, founded
under the auspices of the commissaries
of the government, and professing the
most violent ultra-republican doctrines,
was publicly burnt by the
magistrates and most influential persons
of the place, to show their contempt
and abhorrence of the principles
and actions of the authority set over
them. Other instances of the general
opposition, either to the commissaries
themselves or to the agents they had
appointed and supported, on account
of their violence, their tyrannical measures,
and their anarchical principles,
are too numerous to quote; and, generally
speaking, the feeling was so
strong, that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs les Commissaires</i>,
or rather, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les Citoyens Commissaires</i>,
were obliged to give way before
the expression of popular indignation.</p>

<p>The departments then, for the first
time, have begun to show that they
are determined not to be treated as
the mere humble serfs of the capital,&mdash;that
they are resolved to have a will
and an action of their own. The results
have been such that, even among
the staunch republicans in the provinces,
and among those who look to
the republic as the only form of government
at present suitable to France,
symptoms of a tendency to a federal
system have indubitably sprung up,&mdash;of
a tendency, in fact, to that system
in opposition to which, under the first
revolution, the title of "one and indivisible,"&mdash;so
little understood at the
present day, so constantly repeated by
the herd without any real meaning being
attached to it,&mdash;was bestowed upon
the republic. The fear of a powerfully
organised resistance to the sacred
principles of French republicanism,&mdash;unity
and indivisibility,&mdash;is, at this
very time, one of the bugbears by which
those in power are terrified and haunted.
But, whether this fear be well
founded or not, it suffices for the present
purpose, to show that a disunited
feeling exists to a great extent between
the departments and the capital;
and that, while on the one hand
the former begin to show a disposition
to resist the overweening influence and
tyrannical importance of the former,
on the other, a dread is beginning to
be expressed of their growing discontent,
and a suspicion is constantly
expressed of their increasing tendency
to reactionary principles, likely to
prove eventually subversive to the
republic. Among those "lookers-on,"
who proverbially "see the most
of the game," there are some who,
in their exceptional and impartial
position as foreigners, are able to see
expressed in letters from the provinces
"curses, not loud, but deep," against
"that detestable, unruly, and insolent
Paris, that has made alone a hateful
revolution, which it imposes on all
France." It cannot, however, be said,
at the same time, that any reactionary
feeling against the republic itself, and
a republican form of government,
prevails in the country at large. That
which is thought to be stigmatised by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the ultra party with the term of
"reaction," appears, as yet, to be
nothing but the acceptation of a republic
based upon the principles of
peace and order; but, at the same
time, an opposition to all views and
doctrines likely to produce disorder
and anarchy. And yet still, in another
sense, the feeling of the country at
large cannot be said to be strictly
republican: the "true men" might be
in vain sought except in the disorderly,
tumultuous, excitable, and
easily stirred populations of the great
manufacturing towns.</p>

<p>Shortly after the appointment of
the obnoxious commissaries, several
causes arose to increase the discontent
of the departments, not only among
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</i> upper and middling
classes, but among the lower classes,&mdash;particularly
in the agricultural districts,
and more especially among that
peasant population that has so universally
in France acquired a little property
in land. One of these causes
was the imposition of the new taxes.
Under the former <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, France had
been crushed down by the weight of its
impositions. One of the first advantages
of the republic was announced,
in official proclamations, to consist in
the removal of taxes, and in the enormous
diminution of state expenses
necessarily attendant upon a republican
form of government. Already
the country people looked to a release
from the greater part of their obligations:
the system of "no taxes at all,"
they thought, in their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i>, was to
follow; instead of which came very
shortly the decree, begging the country
for the loan of a certain proportion
of the taxes for the ensuing year
beforehand, in order to meet the deficiencies
in the finances, followed
up almost immediately by the more
imperative ordinance, imposing the
additional 45 per cent in support
of the increased, not diminished, expenses
of the republican government.
In many parts of the country the peasant
population refused to pay this
additional tax, or responded only to
the demand with that equivocal answer,
so characteristic of the French
peasant, "We'll see about it." It
nevertheless, however, refused to pay
at the same time the rents of its landlords,
upon the pretext that it was
ruined by the revolution, and the
exactions of the republic. It was in
vain that the government protested
that these measures were necessitated
by the financial dilapidations of the
dethroned dynasty. Clear-sighted
enough where their own interests are
concerned, the French peasants in the
provinces replied by denunciations of
that odious Paris. Paris, they declared,
had chosen to make for the
nonce a revolution in which they had
not aided, and which they had not
desired; and then Paris turned to its
own advantage alone the results of
that revolution. It had imposed upon
all France, by calling for resources
from a country already drained, to be
lavishly squandered in rewarding the
idleness of its own tumultuous and
unruly inhabitants among the working-classes,
which it dreaded, by the
establishment of its expensive so-called
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ateliers nationaux</i>, and by paying
fresh troops under the name
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gardes mobiles</i>,&mdash;when the standing
army was already such a burden
the country,&mdash;for the sake of draining
off and regularising the worst dregs
of its own population, and satisfying
the caprices of a riotous Parisian mob,
that chose to object to the presence of
the old military force among it, while
it accepted a new defensive and repressive
force, in addition to the
former, under a new title. Upon
such questions, of vital importance to
their own interests, the country people
of the provinces were not disposed to
listen to argument or reason; and
in the discontent at the exorbitant
exactions of the capital the jealousy
of the departments towards Paris
waxed stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>Another cause, which added greatly
to the increasing apprehension and
aversion was the preaching of the communist
doctrines in Paris, upon the first
establishment of republican principles,
and the support apparently given to
these wild and spoliating principles by
certain members of the Provisional
Government itself. If there be any
feeling more alive than any other in
the breast of the French peasant, it is
that attached to the acquirement and
the possession of landed property in
however humble a form, be it but a
small field or a tiny vineyard. If he has
any hope, any ambition, any sentiment,
which he thinks worth living for,
it is the extension, by any and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
means, of his small domain. On the
fact of this possession are concentrated
all the mainspring motives and agencies
of his whole existence&mdash;in this, his
industry, his talent, his cunning, his
thoughts, his affections, his very love
for his children, to whom he hopes to
transmit it. The great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mobile</i> of the
character of the French peasant is
self-interest in this respect. The
doctrines, then, which preached that
the possession of all landed property
by individuals is an infamous spoliation
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res publica</i>, filled the country
people in the provinces with the liveliest
alarm, and contributed to establish
a still greater hatred to a state of
things that tended to produce results so
fatally detrimental to all that they held
dear. The Parisian, almost as blindly
ignorant of the state of his own country&mdash;which,
in his theory that Paris is
all France, he looks upon with indifference,
if not contempt&mdash;as he is
proverbially utterly ignorant of every
other country beyond the frontiers
of France, even the most neighbouring&mdash;and,
in fact, of every thing that
touches upon geography or the state
of nations, of which he has only the
vaguest and most incorrect notions&mdash;thought
that all his wild fraternity
schemes, developed and accepted by
those who possessed nothing, in the
capital, would be received with enthusiasm
also by the "miserable,
oppressed, and tyrannised inhabitant
of the fields and plains;"&mdash;such was
the language used, and eagerly caught
up. The Parisian soon found, by experience,
that he had made a gross
mistake. The emissaries sent down
into the provinces by the professors and
high-priests of communism, or by the
ultra clubs, and supported, there is
every reason to believe, by the members
of the government before alluded
to, met only with the most active
repulsion. Their Utopian ideas of
universal fraternity and spoliation of
property were scorned, scouted, and
opposed: themselves were hooted,
pelted, almost lapidated as incendiary
enemies of the peasant. "The innocent
and humble inhabitant of the
fields" was indignant, insulted, aggrieved,
that he should be so contemptuously
considered "miserable and
oppressed:" he showed himself in the
light of the landed proprietor, the
most avariciously interested in the
possession of property, and by no
means the <em>naif</em> individual the Parisian
had been accustomed to believe him,
according to his text-books of <em>vaudevilles</em>
and melodramas. The agents
of communistic doctrines were forced
to retreat in dudgeon, to declare the
French peasant the most ignorant and
pig-headed animal upon earth, still
under the yoke of the tyrants, and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">endoctriné</i> by the aristocrats; and to
avow that the departments were not
ripe for the enlightenment of communism,
perhaps even to denounce them
as infamously reactionary. Certain
it is that communistic doctrines found
no enthusiastic disciples in the country;
or, if the propagandism made
any steps, it was after the fashion so
characteristically depicted in a caricature
published by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charivari</i>, in
which a peasant appears before the
mayor of his <em>commune</em> to say, that,
since a general <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partage des biens</i> is to
take place, he puts down his name for
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">château</i>, but makes a most wofully
wry face upon hearing that his own
field has been already divided among
the paupers of the village. The propagation
of communism, then, only excited
fears instead of hopes, consternation
instead of joy, and tended still
more to indispose the country people,
and excite their aversion and discontent
towards a state of things likely to
become so prejudicial to their interests:
more than ever, they were disposed to
revolt.</p>

<p>In this state was the feeling of the
country at large when the general
elections came on, accompanied by all
the violence of party manœuvre to
support the principles of ultra-republicanism,
advocated by the unscrupulous
minister of the nation; but all these
efforts tended only to indispose it still
more, and to call forth, in spite of the
desperate opposition made, its sense
in favour of respect of property, order,
and moderatism of views in the republic,
if republic there was to be.
As is well known, an immense majority
of those men of moderate principles,
whom all the ill-judged and
hateful efforts of the violent and reckless
republicans at the head of affairs
had so greatly contributed to form
into a decided, self-conscious, and
compact party of opponents, was returned
to the Assembly. Most of the
leading men of the liberal party under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the former dynasty, who had stood
forward as friends of progressive reform,
but not as opponents to the
constitutional monarchy principle,
were likewise elected, with great majorities,
by the suffrages of the people.
The country declared its will to be
against the views of the principal and
stirring influence which emanated from
the reckless man who governed the
interior affairs of the country in the
capital. But it did not forget, at the
same time, and it still bears an inveterate
grudge to the violent agents
of that ultra-republicanism, chiefly
concentrated in Paris, who had filled
the country with disorder, tumult,
terror, and, in some cases, bloodshed,
by the atrocious and outrageous means
it placed in the hands of a riotous mob
to overawe them, and sway the direction
of the elections, and by the base
manœuvres employed to attain their
ends. It does not forget the despotism
of certain commissaries, who, after
having their own lists of ultra-democratic
candidates, whom they intended
to force down the throats of the electors,
printed, threatened the printer,
who should dare to print any other,
with their high displeasure, and caused
them to shut up their press. It does
not forget the seizure of those papers
that proposed moderate candidates,
with every attempt to strangle in
practice that liberty of the press which
was so clamorously claimed in theory.
It does not forget the voters' lists torn
from the hands of voters by a purposely
excited mob. It does not forget
the odious manœuvre by which agents
were largely paid and sent about to
cry "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive Henri V.</i>" in the streets of
towns, in order to induce the belief
in a Bourbonist reactionary party,
and thus rouse the passions and feelings
of the flattered and declamation-intoxicated
mob against the moderates,
regardless of the consequences&mdash;of
the animosity and the bloodshed. It
does not forget the intimidation, the
threat of fire and sword, the opposition
by force to the voting of whole villages
suspected of moderatism&mdash;the collision,
the constraint, the conflict, the violence.
It does not forget all this,
nor also that it owes the outrage,
the alarm, and the suffering, the
ruin to peace and order, to commerce,
to well-being, to fortune, to that
central power which turned a legion
of demons upon it, in the shape of revolutionary
emissaries and agents. It
forgets still less the scenes of Limoges,
where a mob were turned loose into
the polling-house to destroy the votes,
drive out the national guards, disarm
these defenders of order and right, and
form a mob government, to rule and
terrorise the town, while Master Commissary
looked on, and told the people
that it did well, and laughed in his
sleeve. It forgets still less the fury
of the disappointed upon the result of
the elections, their incitements to insurrections,
their preachings of armed
resistance for the sake of annulling the
elections, obtained, it must never be
forgotten, by <em>universal suffrage</em>, in face
of their culpable manœuvres: the
emissaries again sent down from the
clubs, and with an apparent connivance
of certain ultra-members of the
government, from the charge of which,
now more than ever since the conspiracy
of the 15th May, they will scarcely
be able to acquit themselves: the
efforts of these emissaries to make the
easily excited and tumultuous lower
classes take up arms, and the bloody
conflicts in the streets of Rouen: the
complicity of the very magistrates appointed
by these members of the government&mdash;the
terror and the bloodshed,
and then the cry of the furious
ultras that the people had been treacherously
assassinated&mdash;the conspiracies
and incendiary projects of the vanquished
at Marseilles, the troubles of
Lisle, of Amiens, of Lyons, of Aubusson,
of Rhodez, of Toulouse, of Carcassonne&mdash;why
swell the list of names?&mdash;of
almost every town in France, all
with the same intent of destroying those
elections of representatives which the
country had proclaimed in the sense
of order and of moderatism. It
forgets still less the dangers of that
same 15th May, when the government
was for a few hours overthrown,
by the disorderly, the disappointed,
the discontented, the violent ultra
republicans, the conspirators of Paris,&mdash;when
some of those, who had
been formerly their rulers, were
arrested as accomplices, and others
still in power can scarcely yet again
avoid the accusation and conviction
of complicity.</p>

<p>All the other troubles of this distracted
country, since the revolution
of February, may be passed over&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
ruin to commerce, the poverty, misery,
and want, the military revolts excited
by the same emissaries to cause divisions
in the army, as likewise the
unhappy troubles of Nismes, where
the disturbances took a religions tendency&mdash;as
a conflict of creeds between
Roman Catholics and Protestants,
rather than a political or even a
social character,&mdash;although they still
bore evidence of the disorder of the
times and the disturbance of the
country. The elections, then, contributed
more powerfully than ever to
the fermentation, the discontent, the
mistrust, and the ill-will of the
country.</p>

<p>In this state of France, with the
feeling of impatient jealousy and
irritation against tyranny and despotism
expressed by the departments
towards the capital, with the evident
disunion between the provinces and
Paris, what are likely to be the destinies
of the Republic hereafter?
Again it must be said&mdash;who can tell,
who foresee, who predict? The Republic
has been accepted, and is maintained,
from a love of order and the
<em>status quo</em>: but there is no enthusiasm,
no admiration for the republican form
of government throughout the country
at large; there is, at most, indifference
to any government, whatever
it may be, provided it but
insure the stability and prosperity of
the country. If an opinion may be
hazarded, however, it is, that the
danger to the present established form
of things will not arise so much from
the conflict of contending parties in
the capital, as from the discontent,
disaffection, jealousy, and, perhaps,
final outbreak and resistance of the
departments. Terrorism has had its
day; and it would be difficult, if not
impossible, to apply the system once
again to the country in its present
state. What other means will the
violent possess&mdash;what coercive measures,
if, when parties come to an
issue, the wearied and disgusted
country should rise to protest against
the disorders of Republican Paris?
There seem at present to be none.
The result of such an outbreak would
be inevitable civil war. The strong
instance before alluded to, of the determination
of the departments to
assert a will of their own, was given
in a very striking manner in the affair
of the 15th May. One of the conspirators
got possession of the electric
telegraph at the Home Office, and
sent down despatches into all the provinces,
to inform the country that the
Assembly was dissolved, and the new
government of the ultra-anarchist
party had taken the reins of power.
Instead of being awed into submission
as heretofore, instead of calmly and
resignedly accepting the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>
as was their wont, the departments
immediately rose to protest against
the new revolution of Paris. Before
a counter-despatch could be sent down
into the provinces, to let them know
that the former order of things was
restored, the national guards of all
the great towns were up and out, with
the cry "to arms!" and it was resolved
to march upon Paris. It was not only
in the towns within a day's journey
of the capital that the movement was
spontaneously made. In the furthest
parts of the country, from the cities of
Avignon, Marseilles, Nismes, and all
the south of France, the national
guards were already on their way
towards the capital, before the information
that declared the more
satisfactory result of the day could be
made public. It is more than probable,
then, that, should a desperate
faction ever seize upon the power, or
even should a close conflict of parties
further endanger the safety of the
country and its tottering welfare,
that the provinces would again take
up arms against Paris, and that a
civil war would be the result.</p>

<p>This is rather a suggestion hazarded,
than a prediction made, as to the
future fate of the French republic.
Whatever that future may be, an
uneasy submission on the part of a
great anti-republican majority to the
active agency of a small republican
minority&mdash;but, at the same time, a
desire of maintaining a government,
whatever it may be, if supportable,
for tranquillity's sake; a feeling of
humiliation and degradation in this
utter submission to the will of Paris
throughout the country&mdash;but, at the
same time, an apparent growing determination
eventually to resist that
will, should it at last prove intolerable&mdash;such
is the present state of Republican
France.</p>

<h2>COLONISATION.</h2>

<p><cite>Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia</cite>, &amp;c. By Lieut.-Colonel
Sir <span class="smcap">T. Mitchell</span>, Surveyor-General, &amp;c. 1 vol. London: Longmans.</p>


<p>Australia is the greatest accession
to substantial power ever made
by England. It is the <em>gift</em> of a <em>Continent</em>,
unstained by war, usurpation,
or the sufferings of a people. But
even this is but a narrow view of its
value. It is the addition of a territory,
almost boundless, to the possessions
of mankind; a location for a new
family of man, capable of supporting a
population equal to that of Europe;
or probably, from its command of the
ocean, and from the improved systems,
not merely of commercial communication,
but of agriculture itself, capable
of supplying the wants of double
the population of Europe. It is, in
fact, the virtual future addition of three
hundred millions of human beings, who
otherwise would not have existed.
And besides all this, and perhaps of a
higher order than all, is the transfer
of English civilisation, laws, habits,
industrial activity, and national freedom,
to the richest, but the most
abject countries of the globe; an imperial
England at the Antipodes,
securing, invigorating, and crowning
all its benefits by its religion.</p>

<p>Within the last fifty years, the
population of the British islands has
nearly tripled; it is increasing in
England alone at the rate of a thousand
a day. In every kingdom of the
Continent it is increasing in an immense
ratio. The population is becoming
too great for the means of
existence. Every trade is overworked,
every profession is overstocked,
every expedient for a livelihood
threatens to be exhausted under
this vast and perpetual influx of life;
and the question of questions is, How
is this burthen to be lightened?</p>

<p>There can be but one answer,&mdash;Emigration.
For the last century, common
sense, urged by common necessity,
directed the stream of this
emigration to the great outlying regions
of the western world. North
America was the chief recipient.
Since the conquest of Canada, annual
thousands had directed their emigration
to the British possessions: the
conquest of the Cape has drawn a large
body of settlers to its fine climate;
but Australia remained, and remains
for the grand future field of British
emigration.</p>

<p>The subject has again come before
the British public with additional interest.
The Irish famine, the British
financial difficulties, and the palpable
hazard of leaving a vast pauperism to
grow up in ignorance, have absolutely
compelled an effort to relieve the
country. A motion has just been
made in Parliament by Lord Ashley,
giving the most startling details of
the infant population; and demanding
the means of sending at least its
orphan portion to some of those colonial
possessions, where they may be
trained to habits of industry, and
have at least a chance of an honest
existence. We shall give a few of
these details, and they are of the very
first importance to humanity. On the
6th of June Lord Ashley brought in a
resolution, "That it is expedient that
means be annually provided for the
voluntary emigration, to some one of
her Majesty's colonies, of a certain
number of young persons of both
sexes, who have been educated in the
schools, ordinarily called 'ragged
schools,' in and about the metropolis."</p>

<p>In the speech preparatory to this
resolution, a variety of statements
were made, obtained from the clergy
and laity of London. It was ascertained
that the number of children,
either deserted by their parents, or
sent out by their parents to beg and
steal, could not be less than 30,000 in
the metropolis alone. Their habits
were filthy, wretched, and depraved.
Their places of living by day were the
streets, and by night every conceivable
haunt of misery and sin. They had
no alternative but to starve, or to
grow up into professional thieves,
perhaps murderers. Of the general
population, the police reports stated,
that in 1847 there had been taken
into custody 62,181 individuals of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
both sexes and all ages. Of these,
20,702 were females, and 47,479 males.
Of the whole, 15,693 were under
twenty years of age, 3,682 between
fifteen and ten, and 362 under ten.
Of the whole, 22,075 could neither
read nor write, and 35,227 could read
only, or read and write imperfectly.</p>

<p>The average attendance last year in
the "ragged schools" was 4000. Of
these 400 had been in prison, 600
lived by begging, 178 were the children
of convicts, and 800 had lost one or
both their parents, and of course were
living by their own contrivances. Out
of the 62,000, there were not less than
28,113 who had no trade, or occupation,
or honest livelihood whatever!</p>

<p>The statement then proceeded to
consider the expense to which the
nation was put to keep down crime.
It will perhaps surprise those readers
who object to the expenses of emigration.</p>

<p class="noind">The whole but a few items, yet amounting
to a million sterling annually. In
this we observe the Millbank Penitentiary,
an immense establishment,
Newgate, the Compter, and the various
places of detention in the city,
are not included; and there is no notice
of the expenses of building, which in
the instance of the Penitentiary alone
amounted to a million.</p>

<p>Yet, to dry up the source of this
tremendous evil, Lord Ashley asks
only an expenditure of £100,000 annually,
to transform 30,000 growing
thieves into honest men, idlers into
cultivators of the soil, beggars into
possessors of property, which the generality
of settlers become, on an
average of seven years.</p>

<p>There can be no rational denial of
the benefit, and even of the necessity,
of rescuing those unfortunate
creatures from a career which, beginning
in vice and misery, must go on in
public mischief, and end in individual
ruin. Lord Ashley's suggestion is
that the plan shall be first tried on the
moderate scale of sending 500 boys,
and 500 girls, chosen from the ragged
schools of London, under proper superintendents,
to the most fitting of
the colonies; by which we understand
Australia. The plan may then be
extended to the other parts of the
kingdom, to Scotland and Ireland.
He concluded by placing his motion
in the hands of government, who,
through the Home Secretary, promised
to give it all consideration.</p>

<p>It is certainly lamentable that such
statements are to be made; and we
have little doubt that the foreign journalist
will exult in this evidence of
what they call "the depravity of
England." But, it is to be remembered
that London has a population
of nearly two millions&mdash;that all the
idleness, vice, and beggary of an island
of twenty millions are constantly
pouring into it&mdash;that <em>foreign</em> vice, idleness,
and beggary contribute their
share, and that what is abhorred and
<em>corrected</em> in England, is overlooked,
and even cherished abroad. It is also
to be remembered, that there is a continual
temptation to plunder in the
exposed wealth of the metropolis, and
a continual temptation to mendicancy
in the proverbial humanity of the
people.</p>

<p>Still, crime must be punished wherever
it exists, and vice must be reformed
wherever man has the means;
and, therefore, we shall exult in the
success of any judicious plan of emigration.</p>

<p>It happens, at this moment, that there
is an extraordinary demand for emigration;
that every letter from Australia
calls for a supply of human life,
and especially for an emigration of
females,&mdash;the proportion of males to
females in some of the settlements
being 9 to 1, while the number of
females predominates, by the last
census in England.</p>

<p>There is a daily demand for additional
labourers, artificers, and household
servants, and with offers of wages
which in England neither labourer
nor artisan could hope to obtain.
Thousands are now offered employment,
comfort, and prospective wealth
in Australia, who must burthen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
workhouse at home. The advantages
are so evident, the necessity is so
strong, and the opportunity is so
prompt and perfect, that they <em>must</em>
result in a national plan of constant
emigration, until Australia can contain
no more&mdash;an event which may not
happen for a thousand years.</p>

<p>It happens, also, by a striking coincidence,
that Australian discovery has
just assumed new vigour; and that
instead of the barrenness and deformity
which were generally supposed
to form the principal characteristics
of this vast territory,
immense tracts have been brought to
European knowledge for the first
time, exhibiting remarkable fertility,
and even the most unexpected and
singular beauty. We now give a
sketch of the journey in which those
discoveries were made.</p>

<p>To explore the interior of this great
country has been the object of successive
expeditions for the last five-and-twenty
years. But such was the
want of system or the want of means,
that nothing was done, except to increase
the tales of wonder regarding
the middle regions of Australia. The
theorists were completely divided;
one party insisting on the existence of
a mediterranean or mighty lake in the
central region, <em>because</em> there was a
tendency in some of the small rivers
of the coast to flow inward. Others,
with quite as much plausibility, laughed
at the idea; and, from having felt
a hot wind occasionally blowing from
the west, had no doubt that the central
region was a total waste, a desert
of fiery sand, an Australian Sahara!
while both parties seem to have been
equally erroneous, so far as any actual
discovery has been made.</p>

<p>But it seems equally extraordinary,
that even the only two expeditions
which within our time have added
largely to our knowledge, alike should
have neglected the most obvious and
almost the only useful means of discovery.
The especial object of exploration
must be, to ascertain the
existence of considerable rivers pouring
into the sea, because it is only
thus that the government can effectively
form settlements. The especial
difficulty of the explorers is, to
find provisions, or carry the means of
subsistence along with them. Both
difficulties would be obviated by the
steam-boat, and by nothing else. The
natural process, therefore, would be,
to embark the expedition in a well appointed
and well provisioned steamer;
to anchor it at the necessary distance
from the coast, which in general has
deep and sheltered water, within the
great rocky ridge; and then send out
the explorers for fifty or a hundred
miles north and south, making the
steamer the headquarters. Thus they
might ascertain every feature of the
coast, inch by inch, be secure of subsistence,
and be free from native hostility.</p>

<p>Yet all the expeditions have been
overland, generally with the most imminent
hazard of being starved, and
occasionally losing some of their
number by attacks from the natives.
Thus also the present expedition of
the surveyor succeeded but in part,
though it had the merit of discovering
that the reports of Australian barrenness
belonged but to narrow tracts,
while the general character of the
country towards the north was of
striking fertility. The purpose of
Sir T. Mitchell's late expedition was,
to ascertain the probability of a route
from Sydney to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
But as this route was to be
made dependent on a presumed river
flowing into the gulf, the actual object
was to reach the head of that
river&mdash;an object which could have
been more effectually attained by
tracing it upward from the gulf; and,
in consequence of not so tracing it,
the expedition ultimately failed.</p>

<p>To establish an easy connexion between
the colony of New South Wales
and the traffic of the Indian Ocean
had long been a matter of great interest.
Torres Strait, the only channel
to the north, is a remarkably dangerous
navigation; while, by forming an
overland communication directly with
the Gulf of Carpentaria to the west of
the strait, the commerce would find
an open sea. A trade in horses had
also commenced with India, which
was impeded by the hazards of the
strait. There had also been a steam
communication with England by Singapore,
and there was a hope that this
line might be connected with a line
from the gulf.</p>

<p>The idea of tracing a river towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the north was a conjecture of several
years' standing, in some degree founded
on the natural probability that an
immense indentation of the land could
not but exhibit some outlet for the
course of a considerable fall of waters,
and also that there had been a report
by a Bushman, of having followed its
course to the sea.</p>

<p>After some difficulties with the governor,
which were obviated by a vote
of the Colonial Legislature of £2000
for the expenses of the expedition, it
set out from Paramatta on the 17th
of November 1845. The expedition
consisted of Sir Thomas Mitchell; E.
B. Kennedy, Esq., assistant-surveyor;
William Stephenson, Esq., surgeon
and naturalist; twenty-three convicts,
who volunteered for the sake of a free
pardon, which was to be their only
payment; and three freemen. They
had a numerous list of baggage conveyances,
&amp;c. &amp;c.; eight drays,
drawn by eighty bullocks; two boats,
thirteen horses, four private horses,
three light carts, and provisions for a
year, including two hundred and fifty
sheep, which travelled along with
them, constituting a chief part of their
animal food. They had also gelatine
and pork. The surveyor-general
preferred light carts, and horses in
place of bullocks; but it was suggested
that the strong drays were
necessary, and that bullocks were
more enduring than horses&mdash;the latter
an opinion soon found to be erroneous.
It is rather singular, that
either opinion should not have been
settled fifty years ago.</p>

<p>Some natural and well-expressed
reflections arise, in the course of this
volume, on the lonely life of the
settler. Its despondency, and its inutility
to advance his moral nature,
are in some measure attributed to the
absence of the "gentler sex."</p>

<p>"At this sheep station," says Sir
Thomas, "I met with an individual
who had seen better days, and had
lost his property amid the wreck of
colonial bankruptcies; a 'tee-totaller,'
with Pope's 'Essay on Man' for his
consolation, in a <em>bark hut</em>. This man
spoke of the depravity of shepherd life
as excessive.... The pastoral life,
so favourable to the enjoyment of nature,
has always been a favourite with
the poets. But here it appears to be
the antipodes of all poetry and propriety,
simply because man's better
half is wanting. Under this unfavourable
aspect the white man comes before
the aboriginal. Were they intruders,
accompanied with wives and children,
they would not be half so unwelcome.
In this, too, consists one of the most
striking differences between settling
and squatting. Indeed, if it were an
object to <em>uncivilise</em> the human race, I
know of no method more likely to
effect it, than to isolate a man from the
gentler sex and children. Remove
afar off all courts of justice and means
of redress of grievances, all churches
and schools, all shops where he can
make use of money, and then place
him in close contact with savages.
'What better off am I than a black
native!' was the exclamation of a
shepherd to me."</p>

<p>A general description of the aspect
of New South Wales would be difficult,
from its extreme diversity in
parts; but the general face of the
country is marked by lines of granite
hills; short water-courses, which in
summer are dry, or retain the water
only in pools; clumps of trees, generally
dotted over the soil, and occasional
<em>prairies</em>. But the soil is generally
fertile, and, in the spring,
exhibits a great variety of flowers.
Thus the land is every where fit for
European life, though in the same
latitude with the hottest portions of
Africa. It has occasional gushes of
intense heat, but they seem not to
have affected the health of the expedition;
and with that progress of comforts
which follows all civilisation, the
heat and cold alike may be successfully
mitigated. We have not heard
of any endemic in Australia; the epidemic
has never visited its shores. The
chief want in the pasture-grounds is
water, but even that is merely the result
of the rudeness of early settling;
for vast quantities of water run to
waste, or are lost in swamps, which
future colonists will receive in tanks,
and check with dams. The capricious
abundance and deficiency of this prime
necessary of life, for it is more essential
than food, is shown in a striking,
passage of this picturesque Journal.
They were still within the sheep-feeding
country. Water was much
wanted. Mr Stephenson, the naturalist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was sent out on the inquiry.
He returned soon, having met two of
the mounted police, who told him that
"a flood was coming down from the
Turon Mountains."</p>

<p>"But the little encampment was
held in suspense. Still, the bed of the
Macquarie continued so dry, that the
report could scarcely be believed. Towards
evening, a man was stationed
with a gun, to give a signal on the appearance
of the flood. The shades of
evening came, but no flood; and the
man returned. This was a period of
considerable anxiety, for the need of
water was urgent.</p>

<p>"Some hours later, and after the
moon had risen, a murmuring sound,
like that of a distant waterfall, mingled
with occasional cracks, as of breaking
timber, drew our attention." They
then returned to the river bank. Still
no flood appeared, though they continued
to hear the sounds of the
crashing timber. At length an increase
of the sounds told them that
the water was in the next bend. All
this, in a serene moonlight night, was
new. At length it came, and came
in power and beauty.</p>

<p>"It rushed into our sight, glittering
in the moonbeams, a moving <em>cataract</em>;
tossing before it ancient trees, and
snapping them against its banks. It
was preceded by a <em>point</em> of meandering
water, picking its way, like a
thing of life, through the deepest parts
of the dark, dry, and shady bed of
what thus again became a flowing
river." The phenomenon might make
a fine subject for the pencil, if our
artists were not divided between the
palace and the pigstye. The noble
river rolling along under a <em>tropical</em>
moon; the wild country around, with
its forests and hills touched by the
light; the bronzed faces and bold
figures of the men of the expedition,
gazing with natural surprise and gladness
at this relief, and at the majestic
object before them; and even the
cattle hurrying up from the encampment,
to cool the thirst which had
pressed so severely on them during
the day, all were made for the finest
efforts of the pencil.</p>

<p>"By my party," says Sir T. Mitchell,
"situated as we were at the
time&mdash;beating about the country, and
impeded in our journey solely by
the almost total absence of water&mdash;suffering
excessively from thirst and
extreme heat,&mdash;I am convinced the
scene can <em>never</em> be forgotten! <em>There</em>
came abundance at once, the product
of storms in the far-off mountains,
that <em>overlooked our homes</em>! My first
impulse was to have welcomed this
flood on our knees; for the scene was
sublime in itself, while the subject, an
abundance of water sent to us in a
desert, greatly heightened the effect
to our eyes. I had witnessed nothing
of the kind in all my Australian travels."</p>

<p>But the writer is an accomplished
man of science, and he leads the contemplation
to still more glorious things,
"Even the heavens presented something
new, at least uncommon, and
therefore in harmony with this scene.
The variable Star of Argol had increased
to the first magnitude, just
above the beautiful constellation of
the Southern Cross, which slightly
inclined over the river, in the only
portion of sky seen through the trees.
That very red star, thus increasing
in magnitude, might, as characteristic
of her rivers, be recognised as the
'Star of Australia,' when Europeans
cross the line. The flood gradually
filled up the channel nearly bank high,
while the living cataract travelled onward
much slower than I had expected
to see it; so slowly, indeed,
that more than an hour after its first
arrival, the <em>sweet music</em> of the head of
the flood was distinctly audible from
my tent, as the murmur of waters and
crash of logs travelled slowly through
the tortuous windings of the river bed.
I was finally lulled to sleep by that
melody of waters."</p>

<p>It has been often remarked, that
Europeans once accustomed to a life
of wandering, can never return to the
life of cities; and even the clever journalist
before us appears to have been
a little captivated with this life of the
wilderness. It may be easily admitted,
that vigorous health, and active exercise,
variety of objects, even if those
objects are no more than new ridges
of mountains or new rills of water; with
keen appetite and sound sleep, are all
excellent things in their style. But,
is life given to man only to eat, gaze,
and sleep? What is the life of the wilderness
above that of the brute? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
true improvement of man, and, therefore,
the especial employment intended
for man, is, that increase of
knowledge, of command over the
powers of nature, and of the various
means of adding to the conveniences,
comforts and value of human existence,
which, delivered down to us by
our forefathers, it is our part to deliver
with increase to our posterity.
But the savage improves in nothing; he
is as much a brute this year as he was
a thousand years ago. Savagery is,
in practice, a total defeat and denial of
all the original purposes for which our
nature was made. And it is with some
regret and more surprise, that we
quote, from such a source, such language
as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We set out, guided by our native
friend," (a savage whom they had hired
to lead them to some water-courses.)
"He was a very perfect specimen of
the <em>genus</em> homo, and such as is <em>never</em> to
be seen, except in the precincts of savage
life, <em>undegraded</em> by any scale of
<em>graduated classes</em>; and the countless
<em>bars</em> these present to the free enjoyment
of existence." Whether this is
actually a recommendation that we
should throw off our clothes and walk
in nudity, for the purpose of recovering
the original elegance of our shapes,
or whether it is the borrowed rapture
of some savage in person which the
gallant officer has transplanted into
his pages, to vary his more rational
conceptions, we know not; but he has
<em>not</em> made us converts to the pleasures
of cold, hunger, filth, and bloodshed,
which furnish the realities of savage
life, even in the paradisaic solitudes
of Australia.</p>

<p>The savage, in his original state, is
simply an animal, superior to his own
dog only in sharpness of intellect; but
wholly inferior to his dog in fidelity
and affection. All savages are tyrannical&mdash;cruel
to their wives, if wives
they can be called&mdash;and in general
cheating and plundering wherever
they can. As to their bodily organs,
of course, they cannot be perverted
where they cannot reach temptation;
but no savage comprehends moral restraint,
and he gets drunk whenever
he has the opportunity, and robs
wherever he finds any thing to steal.
On the other hand, civilisation necessarily
enfeebles no man, and what the
gallant Colonel regards as its "degradation
of man by classes," produces
quite the contrary effect; for the humbler
the class, generally the more vigorous&mdash;as
the peasant is a stronger
man than the artisan, and the artisan
than the nobleman. Even the idea
that savage limbs can do more than
civilised, is equally erroneous. A well
clothed and well fed Englishman, if
well formed, and with some training,
will outwork, outrun, and outwrestle
any savage from pole to pole.
A ropedancer, a tumbler, or a horserider,
at any of our theatres, though
bred in the very heart of civilisation,
or even in the hotbed of its temptations,
will perform feats of activity
which would defy all the muscles of
a generation of savages. The truth is,
that civilisation improves the features,
the form, and the powers of the human
frame. Men in society may be indolent,
and throw away their advantages; but
society is the place for man. Rousseau,
once made a noise by talking
nonsense on this subject; but Rousseau
<em>knew</em> that he was talking nonsense.
Whether his imitators are equally
cognisant of their own performances,
is another question; but we come to
better things.</p>

<p>This journey settled the disputed
point of "horses or bullocks, light
carts, or heavy drays." The bullocks
and the drays were a perpetual annoyance;
to feed and water the one, and
to drag the other, soon became the grand
difficulty of the expedition. We find
the Colonel perpetually leaving them
to follow, when any peculiar object
of exploration was in view. At length
the whole "park" was left to take its
rest, under the second in command; and
the Colonel, with eight men, two native
boys, fourteen horses, and two light
carts, with provisions for ten weeks,
moved to the northward, to trace
where the division of the waters was
to be found, and then follow some of
them down to the Gulf.</p>

<p>We were not prepared for the beauty
sometimes exhibited by the Australian
landscape. The Journal compares it
to a succession of Ruysdaels. "The
masses of rock, lofty trees, shining
sands, and patches of water in wild
confusion; the mimosæ, the Anthistiria-grass,
of a red brown, contrasting
most harmoniously with the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
green bushes; all those again so
opposed to the dark hues of the casuarinæ,
mimosæ, and rifted rocks, that
a Ruysdael or a Gainsborough might
have found an inexhaustible stock of
subjects for the pencil."</p>

<p>This wild travelling has its discomforts,
and now and then its dangers;
but it is a perpetual source of exciting
sensations. Every step is new, and
every day's journey may place the
traveller within some region of unexpected
value or beauty. One of the
hopes of the Journalist, on commencing
this portion of his travels, was to
discover a chain of hills to the northwest,
from which he might trace the
course of a river to the Gulf. At last
this chain rose before his eyes.</p>

<p>"The most interesting sight to me
was that of blue pics at a great distance
to the northwest, the object of
all my dreams of discovery for years.
<em>No white man had before seen them.</em>
There we might hope to find the
division of the waters still undiscovered&mdash;the
pass to Carpentaria still
unexplored. I called this hill Mount
First-View, and descended, delighted
with what I had seen from its rocky
crest." The latitude was 27°, yet the
thermometer at sunrise was but at
45°, at noon 68°, and at 9 <small>P.M.</small> 45°.</p>

<p>The captivations of the scenery were
equal to the delights of the temperature,
though so near the tropics.&mdash;"An
Australian morning is always
charming. Amid those scenes of primæval
nature it seemed exquisitely so.
The barita or gymnoskina, the organ-magpie,
was here represented by a
much smaller bird, whose notes, resembling
the softest breathings of a
flute, were the only sounds that met
the ear. What the stillness of evening
adds to such sounds in other climes,
is felt more intensely in the stillness
of morn in this."</p>

<p>The forms of the vegetation, both
tree and shrub, are picturesque, and
the colours are finer still:&mdash;"Instead
of autumnal tints, there is a perpetual
blending of the richest hues of autumn
with the most brilliant verdure of
spring; while the sun's welcome rays
in a winter's morning, and the cool
breath of the woods in a summer
morning, are equally grateful. This
was in the depth of the Australian
winter, and, which sounds oddly to
the European ear, in the 'merry month
of June.'"</p>

<p>Advancing still to the north, a
country of an extraordinary kind was
reached in July; and they had now
found, that most important of all objects
in a wilderness, a fine "flowing
stream, full of sparkling water to the
margin." The Journalist seems quite
enamoured with the surrounding scene,
a miniature Australian Switzerland:&mdash;"The
hills overhanging it surpassed
any I had ever seen, in picturesque
outline. Some resembled Gothic cathedrals
in ruins; some forts; other
masses were perforated; and being
mixed and contrasted with the flowing
outlines of evergreen woods, and
having a fine stream in the foreground,
gave a charming appearance to the
whole country. It was a vision worthy
of the toils of a pilgrimage. Those
beautiful recesses of unpeopled earth
could no longer remain unknown.
The better to mark them out on any
map, I gave to the valley the name of
Salvator Rosa. The rocks stood out
sharply and sublimely from the thick
woods, just as John Martin's fertile
imagination would dash them out in
his beautiful landscapes. I never saw
any thing in nature come so near those
creations of genius and imagination."
But this river, which they followed for
some time, ran so far to the east, that
they justly began to doubt its being
the one of which they were in search
and they turned again to the north.
They now passed into a fine level
country, incomparably formed for settlement.
"An almost boundless extent
of the richest surface in a solitude
corresponding to that of (southern)
China, yet still unoccupied by man.
A great reserve provided by Nature
for the extension of his race."</p>

<p>They left the Salvator between the
21st and 22d degrees of latitude, and
moved to the north-west. There at
length their aspirations, though only
partially, were probably realised.
In the middle of September they
reached some heights, from which lay
before them a vast extent of open
downs traversed by a river, traceable
to the utmost verge of the horizon,
and falling to the <em>north-west</em>! "Ulloa's
delight at the first view of the Pacific
could not have surpassed mine," is the
natural exclamation of the Journalist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
"Nor could the fervour with which
he was impressed have exceeded my
sense of gratitude for being allowed to
make such a discovery. From that
rock the scene was so extensive as to
leave <em>no room for doubt</em> as to the
course of the river, which, then and
there revealed to me alone, seemed like
a reward direct from Heaven for perseverance,
and as a compensation for
the many sacrifices which I had made,
in order to solve the question as to
the interior rivers of tropical Australia."</p>

<p>From the 16th to the 24th of September
the course of the river was
followed, which still was north-west,
but at this period the party returned.
The reason stated is the failure of provisions.
This must have been a most
vexatious disappointment&mdash;so vexatious,
that we cannot comprehend how it
could have been submitted to without
some more remarkable effort than any
thing that we find recorded in these
pages. That an expedition equipped
for a four months' journey should have
turned back at the very moment when
a few days', perhaps a few hours',
march, might have completed its
object, is altogether incomprehensible,
while it had any conceivable means of
subsistence. In such a condition of
things, the traveller ought to have
eaten his horse, if he could get nothing
else. But there was actually, at no
great distance behind, a depôt of their
own bullocks and sheep, all feeding
comfortably, and, as the party found
on marching back to them, "Sheep
and cattle fat, the whole a sort of
farm." A good stackyard had been
set up, a storehouse had been built,
a garden had been fenced in, and contained
lettuce, radishes, melons, and
cucumbers. Indeed, the whole establishment
exhibited the effects of good
order and discipline.</p>

<p>Why, then, did not the Journalist
return on his track, and establish the
discovery which was the express
object of his mission? This exceeds
our knowledge. The only direct intimation
of his necessities in these pages
is, "our provisions were nearly out,
the sun having reduced the <em>mess sugar
and melted the bacon</em>, which had been
boiled before we set out." Whether the
<em>lean</em> of Australian bacon may liquefy
in the sun is more than our European
experience can tell, but we presume it
must be ranked among the wonders of
a new country; at all events, the Journalist
returned without having done
the very thing for which his expedition
had been fitted out, and left the
object to be completed by his subordinate,
who was subsequently despatched
in the direction of the north-west.
Thus, though probabilities are in favour
of the river, which the Colonel named
the Victoria, the point is by no means
settled, and Australian curiosity may
be disappointed after all.</p>

<p>As the party approached the river,
they saw considerable numbers of
the natives. On reaching one of the
lagoons, the shrieks of many women
and children, and the angry voices of
men, apprised them that they had at
length overtaken the tribe, and unfortunately
had come on them by surprise.
"Aya, minya!" was vociferated
repeatedly, and was understood
to mean, "What do you want?" I
steadily adhered to my own tactics
towards the aborigines, and took not
the slightest notice of them, but rode
on according to my compass-bearing.
On looking back for my men, I saw
one beckoning me to return. He had
observed two natives with spears and
clubs hide themselves behind a bush
in the direction in which I was advancing.
On my halting, they stole
away. The whole seemed to have
been amusing themselves in the water
during the noonday heat, which was
excessive, and the cool shades round
the lagoon looked most luxuriant.
Our position, on the contrary, was
any thing but enviable. Even there,
in the heart of the interior, on a river
utterly unheard of by white men, an
iron tomahawk glittered in the hand
of a chief. The anxious care of the
females to carry off their children
seemed the most agreeable feature of
the scene. Some had been digging in
the mud for worms, others searching
for fresh-water mussels, and if the
whole could have been witnessed unperceived,
such a scene of domestic
life among the aborigines had been
worth a little more risk. The strong
men assumed a strange attitude, which
seemed very expressive of surprise,
having the right knee bent, the left leg forward&mdash;the
right arm dropping, but
grasping clubs&mdash;the left arm raised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and the fingers spread out. "Aya,
aya, minya," they continually shouted.
However, the party rode on, and the
shouts died away.</p>

<p>The Journalist occasionally recovers
from his enthusiasm for savagery. We
have no more bursts in his earlier style,
"Such truth and exemption from disease,
such <em>intensity</em> of existence, in
short, must be far beyond the <em>enjoyments
of civilised men</em>, with all that
art can do for them. And the proof
of this is to be found, in the failure of
all attempts to persuade these free
denizens of uncultivated earth to forsake
it for the tilled ground. They
prefer the land, unbroken and free
from the earliest curse pronounced
against the first banished and first
created man." All this unfortunately
shows nothing, but that the gallant
Colonel would be the wiser for going
back to his Bible, where he would find
the words, "I will not again curse the
ground any more for man's sake."
But at last (page 328) we have a sketch
of the reality. "It would appear
that, the finer the climate and the
fewer man's wants, the more he sinks
towards the condition of the lower
animals. Where the natives had
passed the night, no huts, even of
bushes, had been set up. A few tufts
of dry grass only marked the spot,
where, beside a small fire, each person
had sat, folded up like the capital
letter N. Their occupation during
the day was only wallowing in a
muddy hole, in no respect cleaner
than swine. They have no idea of
any necessity for washing themselves
between their birth and the grave,
while groping in mud for worms."
After admitting the filth, the indolence,
and the uselessness of the savage;
contrasting, however, his teeth and
tongue favourably with those of the
civilised man or child, of which he
pronounces it to be "ten to one but
he should find <em>only impurity and decay</em>,"
(a point in which we are wholly
at issue with him,) he asks, "what
then is civilisation in the economy of
the human animal?" He answers,
"Cultivated man despises the perishable
substance, and pursues the immortal
shadow." We are but little
satisfied with the language of this solution,
nor is its meaning much more
intelligible. In the first place, man,
in a civilised state, does not necessarily
injure his bodily organs. The
fool who cannot stir, or even sit, without
a cigar in his mouth, or the drunkard
who continually sacrifices health
and understanding to intoxication,
has only to condemn himself. But,
give the savage tobacco and rum, and
he will as speedily destroy his organs,
and bring himself to the grave, as the
most civilised profligate in existence.
And as to the grand supposed use of
civilisation&mdash;the fixing our minds on
"immortal shadows"&mdash;if by this he
meant giving us ideas of religion,
there are many highly civilised nations
which think but very little of religion,
and many highly civilised persons who
think of it nothing at all. Yet, it is only
justice to the gallant Colonel to quote
this sentence. "Animal gratification
is transient and dull compared to the
acquisition of knowledge, the gratification
of mind,&mdash;the raptures of
the poet, or the delight of the enthusiast,
however imaginary. Such were
my reflections on this day of rest, in
the heart of a desert, while protected
from the sun's rays by a blanket."</p>

<p>But even his metaphysics are entirely
a misconception. The original purpose
of civilisation is, to enable man
to live in society; that is, in peace,
with the advantages of mutual assistance.
That those objects are powerfully
aided by religion is true, and
that science may be best cultivated in
settled life, is equally true; but those
are merely collateral. Civilisation
means the work of law, of safe intercourse,
of secure property, and of all
the safeguards of society which ultimately
enable man to polish the general
manners, and to improve the
general mind. Religion is not the
consequence, but the origin of Civilisation.</p>

<p>We now take leave of the journey,
with the sketch of the rivers. After
moving for some distance between
two streams, they approached the junction,
which formed&mdash;"the broad, deep,
and placid waters of a river as deep
as the Murray. Pelicans and ducks
floated upon it, and mussel shells of
extraordinary size lay in such
quantities, where the natives had
been in the habit of eating them, as
to resemble snow covering the ground.
But even that reach seemed diminutive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
when compared with the vast
body of water of which traces had
been left there; affording evidence,
that though wide, they must have
been impetuous in their course.
Verdure alone shone now, over the
wide extent to which the waters
sometimes rose. Beyond that channel
lay the almost boundless plains;
the whole together forming the finest
region I had ever seen in Australia."</p>

<p>Still the luckless character of the
Australian rivers appears; and after
expecting that this fine channel, which
there seemed navigable for steamers,
would continue, in a few miles more
it exhibited only ponds. Whether the
great central stream may not exhibit
the same caprice, is still the question.</p>

<p>The party returned to Sydney in
January 1847; and in March, Mr
Kennedy, the second in command,
was sent, as has been already stated,
to explore the course of the Victoria.</p>

<p>There are some valuable observations
on the aborigines. It is said
that they have good natural faculties,
all one of them named Uranigh, an
attendant on the expedition, obtains
especial praise for sagacity, fidelity,
and courage. But, from inevitable circumstances,
it appears to be the fate of
the natives to waste away before the
European blood, and, even without any
violence or oppression, gradually to
vanish. To teach them to earn their
bread, to adopt European habits of
any kind, or even to live with any
sense of comfort in the vicinity of
European settlers, seems impossible,
and thus they gradually retire into
the interior. This process has so
uniformly occurred in all colonised
countries, where a new civilisation has
been introduced, that it may be regarded
as almost a law of nature.
"Fire, grass, and kangaroos," are
essential to native life; and when the
pastures are no longer suffered to be
burned, and when the kangaroos disappear,
the savage <em>must</em> retire. Sir
T. Mitchell's favourite project would
be, to send away a young married
pair to the south of Europe, where
they might learn the cultivation of the
grape and olive, fig, &amp;c.; then to
bring them back with their children.
But we are afraid they would make
but few converts; that the benevolent
experiment would be totally thrown
away; and that the poor, idle, and
useless being, whom Sir Thomas will
persist in calling the noble savage,
must be left to eat rats and mice, to
live in misery and wretchedness, and
to be inevitably pushed into the wilderness,
to make way for a superior
class of human capability.</p>

<p>But, regarding the condition of the
natives as utterly beyond European
influence, except so far as it may and
ought to be exerted to protect them
from all injury,&mdash;there are other
questions of high importance, relative
to the condition of the convicts. The
preamble of the Transport Act made
the reformation of the culprit a primary
object. There never was any use of
forced labour so effective. The galley-slaves
of France and Italy were in
general made more wicked, if possible,
by their imprisonment and work. We
think it also next to an impossibility
that any culprit, punished by temporary
imprisonment, and then thrown
out again among his associates, <em>can</em>
change his habits. Who will employ
a known felon? A single act of
robbery may give him more means of
gross gratification, than he could
obtain by the severest toil in a twelvemonth.
The temptation is too strong.
The only hope of his recovery, is in
his being sent where his bad character
will not utterly prevent his getting a
good one; where he will have profitable
work, (let the profit be more or
less;) where he will have few temptations,
and none of his old ones; and
where he may have a prospect of
bettering his condition among his
fellows. All these he had, and has,
in New South Wales.</p>

<p>But it is remarkable and unfortunate,
that we seldom have a new head of the
colonial department who does not bring
with him some new theory; and the
fashionable theory now is, to try the
effect of prison discipline. We have
no hesitation in denouncing this theory,
as ineffectual, intolerably costly,
highly dangerous, and even actually
cruel. We take the points in succession:
we doubt whether it has really
reformed one prisoner out of a thousand.
Its expense is enormous: the single
prison at Millbank cost a million sterling,
and probably £100,000 a-year
for its support. The model prison at
Pentonville is an architectural <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijou</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
but terribly expensive. Men cannot
be reformed by turnkeys in the most
moral costume, or by locks of the most
exquisite invention.&mdash;It is dangerous:
because those felons, once let loose,
almost invariably become felons
again; and a general jail-delivery
once a year, from handcuffs and
shackles, may people the streets with
ruffianism.&mdash;It is even cruel. The
prisoners are not merely deprived, for
a long succession of years, of all
healthful exercise&mdash;for who ever could
take healthful exercise within prison
walls?&mdash;but shut out from all the
view and enjoyment of nature, and especially
from matrimony; they cannot
be husbands or fathers. It is true, that
the felon forfeits all rights, if they are
found incompatible with the public
safety; but we have no <em>right</em> to inflict
on him any suffering beyond that
which is absolutely necessary. If by
sending him to Australia we can accomplish,
without cruelty, those objects
which we <em>cannot</em> accomplish
without cruelty at home, it is our
duty to send him to Australia.</p>

<p>We know that a middle system of
imprisonment, to be followed by transportation,
has been attempted, but we
have no faith in its operations. The
true place is Australia.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Mitchell, the very best
authority on such subjects, tells us,
"There is no country in which labour
appears to be more required to render
it available to, and habitable by civilised
man, than New South Wales.
<em>Without</em> labour, the inhabitants must
be savages, or such helpless people as
we find the Aborigines. With
equal truth, it may be asserted that
there is <em>no region</em> of earth susceptible
of so much improvement solely by
the labour and ingenuity of man."
There are no unwholesome savannahs;
the rocky ranges afford the means of
forming reservoirs, &amp;c., of water,
which, under the tropics, is life, abundance,
and health; there is an immensity
if it be properly used, and
Australia might be made the finest
scene of vegetation and luxuriance in
the world.</p>

<p>We take our leave of this volume
with regret. It is strikingly written;
it excites and rewards curiosity, and
(a few rambling ideas excepted) it
powerfully increases our interest in
Australian discovery, and in that
whole mighty region of the Pacific,
which God's providence has given into
the hands of England, for the happiness
of mankind.</p>

<h2>SIBERIA.</h2>

<p><cite>Travels in Siberia: including Excursions Northwards, down the Obi to the Polar
Circle, and Southwards to the Chinese Frontier.</cite> By <span class="smcap">Adolph Erman</span>. Translated
from the German by <span class="smcap">W. R. Cooley</span>. Two vols. London, 1848.</p>


<p>Of no important portion of the
dominions of the five great European
powers are such vague and imperfect
notions entertained, as of the vast
tract comprised between Russia in
Europe and the Kamschatkan sea,
between the Chinese empire and the
Arctic Ocean. Courageous explorers
have not been wanting, of the inclement
steppes and rugged mountains
forming Europe's bulwark against the
Mongul and the Tartar. Men of
enterprise and distinction have undertaken
the task, and executed it well.
But their journeys, usually performed
with special objects and scientific
views, have been recorded for the most
part in a similar spirit. Either an ardent
love of science and zeal for its
advancement, or the strong encouragement
and liberal subsidies of an enlightened
government, are requisite
inducements to brave the perils and
hardships of Siberian travel. The
mere inquisitive and speculative traveller
has difficulty in persuading
himself, that the country can reward
him for the discomfort and inconvenience
he must endure in traversing it.
Not that Siberia is entirely devoid of
wild attractions and romantic associations.
To the adventurous hunter, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
vast forests and thinly-peopled plains
give assurance of sport. The motley
character of its native and immigrant
population affords to the philosopher
curious matter of consideration. A
place of deportation for traitors and
criminals&mdash;and not unfrequently for
the innocent&mdash;its name is inseparably
connected with the memory of innumerable
unfortunates who have there
pined out their existence in expiation
of crime, or in obedience to mandates
often as unjust as arbitrary. Fallen
favourites of the Czars, rebels against
their tyranny, traitors to their person,
murderers, and other malefactors,
and even prisoners of war, have
here found a living grave till released by
death, clemency, or flight. Did the
tears of exiles fertilise, Siberia should
be a teeming land. Since its first subjugation
by Ivan the Terrible, how many
a Russian magnate, lord of thousands
of serfs, owner of millions of rubles,
proud of his position, and confident of
imperial favour, has suddenly found
himself travelling eastward under
escort, banished and a beggar. How
many mournful trains of minor offenders
have plodded their weary way
across the Uralian chain, guarded by
barbarian Bashkirs, to labour in the
mines of Nerchinsk, or to lead a
peasant's toilsome life on the margin
of the Frozen Sea. From those vast and
ice-bound regions, escape can rarely be
accomplished. But at intervals, during
the last five-and-thirty years, bearded
and toil-worn men of martial aspect
have crossed the German frontier, and
astonished those they accosted by wild
tales of suffering, and ignorance of the
most notorious events. Some have
inquired for Napoleon, and wept when
they learned he was a captive, or
dead. Circumstances of current history,
known to each child and peasant,
were to them a mystery and a marvel.
These strange wanderers, escaped
from long bondage in Siberia, were
amongst the last survivors of that
countless host led northwards by a
Corsican's ambition, and whose funeral
pile was lighted in Moscow's city.</p>

<p>Amongst the delineators of Siberia
and its inhabitants, of the produce,
customs, and peculiarities of the country
and its people, one of the most
successful is the German gentleman
and scholar whose admirable work
has just now appeared in a clever
English dress. The son of a man
of great learning and high attainments,
Mr Adolph Erman treads
nobly in his father's footsteps. Still
young, he has done much to increase
the lustre of the honourable
name transmitted to him. Born in
the year 1806, he was but two-and-twenty
years of age when he undertook,
at his own cost, a journey round
the world, having for its chief object
a series of magnetical observations.
The expedition was completely successful.
Starting from Berlin to St
Petersburg, he crossed northern Asia,
with occasional digressions of a few
hundred leagues, took ship at Okhotsk
for Kamschatka, thence proceeded to
California, visited Otaheite, and came
round by Cape Horn and Rio Janeiro
to Europe and Berlin. Then he sat
down to write of what he had seen,
entitling his work&mdash;"Journey round
the Earth, across North Asia and both
Oceans." But the tale of travel so
extensive takes time to tell; and, up
to the present date, he has not protracted
his narrative beyond Okhotsk.
What he has done, however, is complete
in itself, very interesting, and
withal somewhat voluminous, since
its abridged translation forms two
heavy octavos, heavy in amount of
paper and print, but not, we must in
justice admit, in the nature of their
contents. Whilst recording scientific
investigations, the author does not
neglect subjects more generally interesting.
Upon all he brings to bear
an extraordinary amount of reading
and research. The result is a book of
travels of no ephemeral nature, but
that will long be esteemed as a standard
work, and respected as a valuable
authority.</p>

<p>Mr Erman commences his narrative
of travel on the day of his departure
from Berlin; but its earlier portion
has been compressed by the translator,
in order to escape as soon
as possible from Europe, and get
upon the less trodden ground east
of Tobolsk. Much has been written
of late years concerning European
Russia and its inhabitants, and it was
hardly to be expected that even so
acute an observer as Mr Erman
should find any thing particularly
novel to say about them. He takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a sensible and practical view of the
condition, character, and disposition
of the population; and is happy in
his detection and indication of national
peculiarities. He does not,
like the majority of travellers in
Russia, enter the country with a
settled determination to behold nothing,
from the White Sea to the
Black, but oppression and cruelty on
the one hand, slavery and suffering
upon the other. He does not come
to a premature decision, that because
Russia is ruled by an absolute
monarch, all happiness, prosperity,
and justice are essentially banished
from the land. It is really pleasant
to find a deviation from the established
routine of books about Russia. These
are now nearly all concocted upon one
and the same plan. The recipe is as
exact as any in Mrs Rundell: and is
as conscientiously adhered to by
literary cooks, as that great artist's
invaluable precepts are by knights
and ladies of the ladle. Tyranny,
misery, and the knout are the chief
ingredients of the savoury dish.
We are shown a nation of cretins,
crushed under the boot-heel of an imperial
ogre; whilst a selfish, servile
aristocracy salaam their admiration,
and catch greedily at the titles and
gewgaws thrown to them as a sop
by their terrible master. This is the
substance of the mess, which, being
handsomely garnished with lying
anecdotes of horrible cruelties practised
upon the unfortunate population,
is deemed sufficiently dainty to set
before the public, and is forthwith
devoured as genuine and nutritive
food by the large body of simpletons
who take type for a guarantee of
veracity. Mr Erman despises the
common trick and claptrap resorted
to by vulgar writers. Avoiding
anecdotage, and abuse of the powers
that be, he gives, in brief shrewd paragraphs,
glimpses of Muscovite character
and feelings, which clearly prove
the people of that vast empire to
be far happier, more prosperous, and
more practically free, than the inhabitants
of many countries who boast
of liberty because anarchy has replaced
good government. Judging
less from any distinct assertions or
arguments advanced in these volumes,
than from their general tenor, and
by the inferences to be gleaned from
them, we must consider the Russians
a contented and flourishing nation,
likely to make the larger strides in
civilisation that they are unimpeded
by revolutionary agitation. Propagandists
meet little encouragement
amongst the loyal and light-hearted
subjects of the autocrat.
"We have often observed at Moscow,"
says Mr Erman, "birch-trees hewn
for fencing, yet still alive in the horizontal
position, and throwing out
shoots. The great distinction of
the vegetable nature in this region is
its tenacity of life; and, singularly
enough, the same capability of existing
under oppression, and of
withstanding stubbornly every revolutionising
influence, is here the
characteristic of man also. The ear
of the stranger is sure, at every turn
of conversation, to catch the sounds&mdash;'Kak
ni bud,' (no matter how,)
with which the Russians are used to
give expression to their habitual indifference,
and renunciation of all
care.... Notwithstanding the
great variety of condition which the
population exhibit, every thing has
the stamp of nationality, and an
obstinate adherence to established
usage may be plainly recognised as a
fundamental principle. Some foreign
customs, indeed, are adopted from
strangers residing in Moscow; but
they are, at the same time, so changed
as to be assimilated to the national
manners. Russian nationality may
be compared to a river, which receives
other streams without changing its
name; or, still better, to a living
organism, which, while devouring
every variety of food, continues still
the same."</p>

<p>It was on the 29th of July that
Mr Erman, who travelled in company
with the Norwegian professor
Hansteen, left Moscow, and moved
eastwards, passing through a productive
country, strewn with populous
and comfortable villages. At Pokròf,
his first halting-place, his chamber
walls were adorned with rude carvings
and paintings, whose subjects were
taken from the events of 1812, and
represented the valiant deeds of the
peasantry. Buikova, a village forty
miles east of Moscow, was the farthest
point to which the French penetrated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Their invasion has left but a faint
impression upon the popular mind in
Russia&mdash;even in Moscow, which suffered
so much at their hands. Conflagrations
have been common occurrences
in that city, and the inhabitants
are accustomed to be burned out.
We read of seven such events, from
the thirteenth to the beginning of the
nineteenth century, in all of which
the destruction was complete, or very
nearly so. The fire of 1812 spared
many of the stone churches, on whose
towers "the Mahomedan crescent
rises above the cross, a monument of
earlier revolutions. The yoke of the
Tatars was so lasting and oppressive,
that later events of a similar kind
seem comparatively unimportant;
and even the French invasion is here
thought little of, being usually compared
with the irruptions of the
Pechenegues and that of the Poles in
later times, but never set on a level
with the Tatar domination." The
French have little prestige in Russia.
Whatever respect they previously
enjoyed there, was completely annihilated
by the pitiful figure they cut in
the Moscow campaign; retreating, as
they did, a ragged, disorderly, frost-bitten
remnant, before a swarm of
armed peasants and irregular horse.
And Muscovite sign-painters and saint-carvers
decorate village walls with episodes
of the disastrous overthrow of an
army, probably the most powerful and
really efficient ever got together. Any
notion entertained by the Russians
of French invincibility was as completely
dissipated in that country by
the events of 1812, as it was in Germany
by the ensuing, and scarcely
less important, campaign of 1813.</p>

<p>Passing Murom, where a sort of
Yankee tradition exists of a "robber-nightingale,"
which entices travellers
into the woods by its song, and then
kills them by the power of its notes,
Mr Erman reached Nijni Novgorod at
the moment of the great annual fair.
The mixture of European and Asiatic
produce and manufactures gives the
Russian fairs an appearance singularly
striking to the foreigner's eye. Things
the most opposite are there brought
together. <i>Obrasá</i>, or Greek holy
images, amulets, and other objects
used in the solemnities of the Græco-Russian
church, are seen in juxtaposition
with the elegant luxuries and
superfluities of extreme European
civilisation. The clumsy carvings of
Uralian peasants are found in the
next warerooms to the fragile and
fashionable masterpieces of a Parisian
milliner. The chief part of the goods
come from great distances. Amongst
the important articles of traffic are
tea from China, horse-hides from
Tatary, iron bars from Siberia, shawls
of camel's-down from Bokhara. The
Bokharians also import large quantities
of cotton, partly raw and partly
spun. This is one of the principal
objects of trade at Nijni. Concerning
the origin of this useful substance,
curious fables were current in
Russia not quite a century ago. "It
appears to me certain," says Mr Erman,
"that the story of the zoophytic
plant called Baránez, or lamb-plant
(formed as a diminutive from Barán,
a sheep,) originated in some embellished
account of the cotton plant.
Herberstein relates it at full length
and unchanged, just as he had heard
it. 'There has been seen, near to
the Caspian Sea, a seed, rather larger
and rounder than that of a melon,
from which, when set in the ground,
is produced something similar to a
lamb, of the altitude of five palms,
having a very fine fleece, &amp;c., &amp;c. The
German edition of Herberstein (Basel,
1563) adds that the Baránez has
a head, eyes, ears, and all the limbs,
like a sheep. But it mentions correctly
'<em>the very fine fleece which the
people of that country commonly made
use of to pad their caps withal</em>.' This
is the ordinary use which the Tatar
tribes in general make of cotton at
the present day." The fair at Nijni
lasts two months, and brings together
six hundred thousand persons of different
nations and tribes, or about
thirty-three times the number of the
stationary population. It produces a
large revenue to the imperial treasury,&mdash;the
letting of the wooden booths, and
of two thousand five hundred and
twenty-two stone storerooms, (to
each of which latter is attached a
chamber for the owner of the goods
to live in) alone yielding, so far back
as 1825, nearly four hundred thousand
rubles; whilst the population of the
government, or district, amounting to
nearly a million of souls, paid taxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to the amount of fourteen millions of
rubles.</p>

<p>Nijni Novgorod is the point of rendezvous
for criminals from the western
provinces of the empire, condemned
to Siberian exile. They arrive there
in small detachments, to pursue their
journey in large bodies. In the vicinity
of every post-house along the
road is another building known as the
Ostrog or fort, which is merely a
large barrack divided into numerous
small chambers, and surrounded by a
fence of palisades, where the convicts
are lodged upon the journey. From
various passages scattered through
Mr Erman's book, it appears that
these Siberian exiles are by no means
so badly treated as has frequently
been stated and believed. In most
instances the punishment derives its
severity less from any painful toil or
cruel discipline imposed upon them,
than from the rigidity of the climate,
the separation from friends, and the
mortal ennui those accustomed to
civilisation and society cannot but
experience, whilst leading the monotonous
life of a peasant or Cossack in
regions as dreary as any the globe's
surface affords. The first caravan of
prisoners encountered by Mr Erman,
at about a hundred versts beyond
Nijni, were well clothed and cared
for, and seemed neither dissatisfied
with their past journey, nor overwhelmed
with care about the future.
"With every train of them are several
waggons, drawn by post-horses, to
carry the women and the old and
infirm men; the rest follow in pairs,
in a long train, after the waggons,
escorted by a militia established in
the villages. It is but rarely that
one sees special offenders with fetters
upon their legs during the march."
The majority of tales circulated by
romancing travellers, with reference
to Siberian exile, have little foundation
save in the imagination of the
narrators. Amongst these fictions is
to be reckoned the statement that
certain classes of the banished are
compelled to pass their lives in hunting
the sable, and other animals. The
great majority of the delinquents are
condemned only to settle in Siberia;
and when hard labour in the Uralian
mines, and in certain manufactories,
is superadded, it is generally for a
year or other limited period. Those
of the peasant class have to support
themselves, whilst offenders of a
higher rank, and unused to manual
labour, have an allowance made them
by the government. In various places
Mr Erman met with exiles, from some
of whom he obtained curious information.
They are usually known by
the mild name of "<em>the unfortunates</em>,"
and are held in no particular disfavour
by the natives, with whose families
they intermarry. By a remarkable
enactment of the Russian law, serfs,
when transported to Siberia, become
in all respects as free as the peasants
in western Europe. Mr Erman refers
to this with strong approval, and
attributes to it the happiest results.
"I have often," he says, "heard intelligent
and reflecting Russians mention,
as an almost inexplicable paradox,
that the peasants condemned to become
settlers, all, without exception,
and in a very short time, change their
habits and lead an exemplary life;
yet it is certain that the sense of the
benefit conferred on them by the gift
of personal freedom is the sole cause
of this conversion. Banishment subservient
to colonisation, instead of
close imprisonment, is, indeed, an
excellent feature in the Russian code;
and though the substitution of forced
labour in mines for the punishment of
death may be traced back to Grecian
example, yet the improving of the
offender's condition by bestowing on
him personal freedom, is an original
as well as an admirable addition of a
Russian legislator." It is of course
by the higher class of exiles that the
banishment is most severely felt; but
these live in the towns, that the succour
received from government may
reach them the more easily, and submit,
for the most part, with great
equanimity to the startling change
from the luxury of Moscow or St
Petersburg, to the dulness and simplicity
of Tobolsk, and even of worse
places. Some of them have to do
penance in church for a certain time
after their arrival, and a portion of
these continue the practice when it is
no longer compulsory. At Beresov,
a town in western Siberia, which Mr
Erman passed through on an excursion
northwards from Tobolsk, the
oral chronicles of the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
furnish curious details of the numerous
illustrious exiles who have there
ended their days. Menchikoff, the
well-known favourite of Peter I., was
one of these. "After his political
extinction, he prepared himself, by
devout penitence, for his natural decease.
He worked with his own
hands in erecting the little wooden
church, now fallen to decay, which
stands thirty or forty feet above the
bank of the Sosva, at the southern
extremity of the town: he then
served in it as bell-ringer, and was
finally buried by the grateful inhabitants
of Beresov, immediately before
the door of the building." It was
here, at Beresov, that Mr Erman fell
in with a number of unlucky conspirators,
who had lost fortune, rank,
and home, by their association in a
recent abortive revolutionary attempt.
Amongst them were a M. Gorski, at
one time a count and general of cavalry,
and the ex-chieftains Focht
and Chernilov. They usually wore
the costume of the country, but upon
holidays they donned European coats,
<em>in order to display the vestiges of the
orders which had once been sewed upon
them</em>. A curious instance of vanity,
traceable, perhaps, to a desire to distinguish
themselves from persons
condemned to the same punishment
for crimes of a more disgraceful
nature.</p>

<p>In the streets of Yekaterinburg, the
first town of importance after crossing
the Asian boundary, parties of exiles are
a frequent spectacle; the number passing
through in a year being estimated
at five thousand, or about two-fifths of
the annual export of convicts to
Siberia, as stated by Mr Stepanov,
whose statement, however, Mr Erman
seems disposed to consider exaggerated.
The detachments are usually
guarded by Kosaks of the Ural, and
by a company of Bashkir militia.
These Uralian Kosaks are well uniformed,
armed, and mounted, and
enjoy the same privileges as the
Kosaks of the Don. They are allowed
an immunity from every impost, but
are bound to devote themselves to
the public service. Touching the
Bashkirs, another irregular and half-savage
militia, serving to swell the
ranks of Russia's enormous army, Mr
Erman, who made some stay at Yekaterinburg,
the northern limit of
their residence, gives curious particulars.
They are the only aboriginal
Siberian tribe whose mode of life
regularly alternates from the nomadic
to the fixed. Their winters are passed
in permanent villages of wooden huts,
erected usually upon the skirt of a
forest. But when spring approaches,
they collect their flocks and herds,
strap hair tent-cloths upon their
saddles, and are off to the plains.
They appear to live upon horseback,
and are indolent, indocile, and useless
out of the saddle. The only thing the
men do, is to drive home the mares at
milking-time; all other domestic toil
is left to the women. And although
grass abounds in the summer pastures,
hay is unknown amongst them. The
cattle sustain life in winter as best
they may, on stunted or decayed herbage,
sought under the snow and
gathered on the dunghills. Fermented
mare's milk is the favorite drink of
the Bashkirs, who live chiefly upon
mutton and fish, and upon the fruit
of the bird-cherry (<i>Prunus padus</i>)
kneaded into a sort of cake. In the
chase they make use of hawks, which
they are particularly skilful in training.
The smaller species of these
birds are used to take hares, whilst
the greater will strike foxes, and even
wolves. The roving careless life of the
Bashkirs possesses a peculiar charm,
admitted even by the civilised Russians;
and it is with no good will that,
on the return of winter, the tribes re-enter
their settled habitations. "They
approach them with reluctance, and believe
that Shaitan, or the evil spirit,
has taken up his abode in the huts
that oppress them with such a sense
of restraint. The men accordingly
remain at some distance from the
settlement, and send the women forward,
armed with staves, with which
they strike the door of every hut,
uttering loud imprecations; and it is
not till they have made the rounds
with their noisy exorcisms, that the
men ride forward at full speed and
with terrific shouts, to banish the
dreaded demon from his lurking-place."
The chief weapon of these
Bedouins of the north is the same
which so forcibly excited Captain
Dalgetty's risibility upon his visit to
the Children of the Mist. But although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in these days of Paixhans and
percussion, bows and arrows certainly
appear rather anomalous, they
are by no means contemptible weapons
in the hands of some of the Siberian
tribes. Of this Mr Erman had
abundant opportunity to convince
himself, especially when his ramble
northwards from Tobolsk brought
him amongst the Ostyaks of the river
Obi. The ordinary hunting weapons
of these people are bows six feet long,
of very slight curve, and from which
four-feet arrows are discharged with
murderous effect. Much practice and
strength are required to draw these
bows; and our scientific traveller,
who, not having taken the necessary
precaution of shielding the left arm
with a piece of horn, from the recoil
of the string, had been unable to
draw his bow to more than one third
of the arrow's length, was not a little
astounded to see an Ostyak pigmy,
with sore eyes and a sickly aspect,
send a blunt arrow one hundred and
sixty feet, and strike the object aimed
at, the stem of a larch, near its summit,
fully sixty feet from the ground.
Blunt arrows, headed with flattened
iron balls, are used to kill sables and
squirrels, that the skin may not be
injured; the sharp ones are a settler
for any quadruped the country produces.</p>

<p>After many days' journey through
Tatar villages of wooden huts, and
towns that are little better, the first
view of Tobolsk, obtained some miles
before reaching the place, is quite imposing;
and the traveller, who might
think he had got a few stages beyond
civilisation, is cheered and encouraged
by the sight of church-towers, lofty
monasteries, and well-built houses.
In vain does he seek an inn. Such
things are unknown in Siberia; and,
if he has no acquaintance in the town,
he must apply to the police-master,
who recommends him to the hospitality
of an inhabitant, by whom he is
made welcome during his stay, without
demand for remuneration, although,
if proffered, it will sometimes
be accepted. In this manner Mr
Erman and his companions were accommodated
in the upper storey of a
well-built wooden house; and here
their progress eastward was arrested
by the character of the weather. It
was the commencement of October,
the period of transition from summer
to winter, and the traveller's entrance
into the town was rendered memorable
by a heavy fall of snow&mdash;"white
flies," as the postilions called the
flakes, which they beheld with much
pleasure. Their satisfaction was probably
owing to the fact that in
Siberia the coldest part of the year is
the most favourable for travelling,
a matter of interest to people of
their profession. But the moment of
transition, whilst the struggle lasts
between summer and winter, when
snow encumbers the ground, and
frost has not yet hardened it, is known,
as well as the similar period at the
close of winter, as "the time of the
unroading," (spoiling of the roads;)
and the Russians have even manufactured
a verb "to be unroaded."
The snow obstructs wheeled carriages,
and forbids the use of the sledge; and,
unless peremptorily compelled to move
forward, the Russian merchants&mdash;the
most experienced of Siberian travellers&mdash;await,
in some convenient resting-place,
the hardening of the winter
road. From Mr Erman's account, a
better place than Tobolsk could
scarcely be found, in those wild regions,
wherein to pass a few weeks of compulsory
inaction. Nevertheless, and
although cordially received by the
governor-general, Velyaminov, from
whom, and from other Russian officers,
he got much useful information,
our traveller was impatient to be off.
He had a pet scheme in view. From
the very commencement of the journey
he had planned an excursion to the
mouth of the Obi, within the Arctic
circle. To this he was partly induced
by the desire of tracing certain magnetic
lines, and partly by "the alluring
prospect of enjoying, on the northern
part of the Obi, the first undisturbed
intercourse with the aboriginal possessors
of the land, where they are
little changed by foreign influence."
Accordingly, towards the middle of November,
the drifting ice upon the Irtuish
having united into a solid sheet, Mr
Erman joyfully made final preparations
for his journey to Obdorsk. They were
few, and soon completed. A Kosak
guide and interpreter, a fur dress, a
copper kettle, bread and ham, salted
salmon and caviar, were stowed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
couple of sledges, one of which was
light enough to be drawn by dogs or
reindeer. It was held advisable also
to take out a fresh passport, signed
by the governor of Tobolsk, in lieu of
the one delivered at St Petersburg,
for, in places far removed from the
great road across Siberia, people have
confused and indistinct notions of the
power which issues from the capital
of the empire. The larger sledge was
provided with otvódi or guides&mdash;two
strong bars placed lengthways on
either side the carriage to prevent an
upset. "Towards the end of winter,
the snow-ways, which are constantly
travelled upon, have an undulating
surface, like that of a stormy sea, and
give the sledge a motion so like that
of a ship tossed on the waves, that
travellers unused to it often grow sea-sick
on the road, and the use of otvódi
is a very necessary precaution."
Russian travelling, delightfully rapid,
has many drawbacks. Upon the log-roads,
(formed of tree-trunks,) the
violent and incessant jolting is said to
have even worse effects than the excessive
undulations of the sledge.
After a few years, it not only brings
on a complete paralysis of the mental
faculties of the Russian postilions,
but also occasions spinal disease, to
such an extent as to have obtained
for those roads the significant name
of spine-crushers.</p>

<p>On the 22d November, when Mr
Erman began his slide northwards,
traffic had not yet given the road that
wavy configuration so uncomfortable
to the bilious traveller. The post
from Tobolsk to Beresov had made
but one journey on the winter-track,
and the sledges glided rapidly and
smoothly on the almost virgin snow-way.
Beyond Tugalova, a village
140 miles from Tobolsk, they travelled
on the frozen Irtuish, and frequently
passed the self-acting machinery used
for the winter fishing. This consists
of a strong pole in an inclined position,
with its lower extremity frozen fast in
the ice. "At the upper end of this
pole was a continuation made of
switches, which, bending down, reached
to the surface of the ice; at that
point was a hole through which was
let down the hook and line. The
upper part of the apparatus is seen
bent down more or less according as
the bait is still untouched, or as a fish
pulling at it has freed a check put to
the elasticity of the rod, and is thus,
in consequence of its own efforts,
drawn nearer to the surface of the
water." The ingenuity of this contrivance
would avail little, however,
were not means found of rousing the
sleepy sturgeon from their winter
slumbers. They lie in muddy hollows
in the bed of the river, quite motionless,
and clustered together for the
sake of warmth. To awaken them,
hard balls of clay, heated in the fire,
are thrown from time to time into the
water, below the line. Driven from
their resting-place, they swim up
stream, according to their custom, and
come upon the bait. This mode of
fishing is very productive. Fishing, of
one kind or other, is the principal occupation
of the Ostyaks, in the heart
of whose country, after three or four
days' journey, Mr Erman found himself.
The rivers abound with excellent
fish&mdash;eels, especially, being very
abundant, but not much eaten, although
their skins are in great request
as window-panes. These are rubbed
with fat, to make them more transparent,
but there are small roundish
swellings in the skin which refract and
confound the rays of light. A better
substitute for glass is a flake of ice,
used by the Sosnovian Ostyaks, a
tribe further north. The flakes are
about a foot thick, and are propped
from without by a pole, whose lower
end bears obliquely against the ground.
The fire, kept burning in the hut,
thaws the inner surface of the ice,
rendering it smooth as a mirror. A
whiter and brighter light penetrates
through these windows than through
the fish-skins, which the Sosnovians
use for boots, and even for clothes.
Strong and air-tight, and well rubbed
with fat, they are almost as warm as
fur, and better against the wet.</p>

<p>The commencement of a fishing
season or expedition is celebrated by
the Ostyaks with all manner of
queer saturnalia. Although nominally
Christians, and accustomed to
attend church once a-year, they are
very heathenish in some of their
rites and ceremonies, and make a
strange jumble of their old superstitions
and their new faith. The priests
do not invariably set them a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
example. "Our Russian informant
complained bitterly of the priest in his
neighbourhood, who came into the village
on holidays so drunk, that the congregation
assembled to no purpose."
With such pastors, no wonder if the
sheep cleave to some of their ancient
usages. Those who are departing on
an expedition, slaughter a tame animal,
and smear their faces with its blood, accompanying
the sacrifice with a carousal.
In one village Mr Erman found
the huts remarkably empty, and was
told that the men had just gone a-fishing,
and that their wives were
drinking brandy in the kabak or
public-house. The sale of spirits in
Siberia, as in all the Russian dominions,
is a government monopoly,
and brandy is only to be had in certain
houses, to whose keepers the
privilege is farmed. In a small dark
room, scarcely ten paces wide, Mr
Erman found ten or twelve Ostyak
dames clustered round the bottle, and
benevolently drunk. His account of
their maudlin state is amusingly grave
and sentimental. "A number of short
corpulent figures, with black sparkling
eyes, could be just seen, moving and
mingling together, in the narrow
space. They all talked with animation,
and with remarkably delicate
voices, which now gave expression
only to soft and joyous emotions.
They embraced, one after the other,
the Yamschik, who entered with us;
and their soft voices, now almost
whining, seemed attuned, not so much
to words of old acquaintance, as to the
endearments of young and growing
love." The ladies having emptied
their purses without quenching their
thirst, the good-natured German, who
observed that "the pleasure of drinking
had but just risen to its highest
pitch," opened them a credit with the
kabak-keeper. "They now took
especial pains to show themselves deserving
of the European treat, by
good Christian observance. Devout
Russians are in the habit of neutralising
the Satanic operation of spirituous
liquors by a rapid movement of
the right hand, intended to describe
the cross, or by a softly-ejaculated
prayer, or merely by blowing the
breath upon the glass. But the good-humoured
Ostyaks, novices in Christian
prayer as in drinking, made the
sign of the cross to such an extent, so
slowly and with such deep bowing of
the body, as would be required by the
church only on the most solemn occasions."</p>

<p>Although much engrossed by fishing,
the Ostyaks do not neglect the
chase. Their thick woods abound in
the better kinds of fur animals, and
the annual tribute of two sable skins,
payable by each family to the Russian
government, is not very difficult to
obtain. It is seldom found necessary
to pay an equivalent in other skins.
Although quite the beginning of
winter, Mr Erman's host, in an
Ostyak village, showed him a fine
sable skin, which he kept in a strong
box, like a treasure, concealed in a
corner of his dwelling. Its value
was diminished by a yellowish tinge,
ascribed to the animal's having lived
in a wood where there was too much
light. Besides sable and squirrel, the
reindeer, the fox, the glutton, and the
elk, are objects of chase. Mr Erman
tried to get at the fact of the enmity
said to exist between the two latter animals.
The reply to his inquiries was
the old story current in Europe&mdash;how
the glutton leaps from a branch on the
elk's neck, and keeps his seat till the
death of his steed. No one, however,
had seen any thing of the kind: it was
matter of tradition, handed down from
their dead fathers. The ermine is
taken in traps. The fox is in great
variety, the most esteemed being the
crossed stone fox, whose colour is
partly a grayish yellow, partly white,
so distributed that the grayish parts
unite prettily to form a cross, one bar
of which extends along the back,
whilst the other stretches obliquely
down the middle ribs to the belly.
The fur of this animal is greatly prized
by the Russian clergy, for whom
pelisses, covered with natural crosses,
are made from it. The latitude of the
town of Beresov is the headquarters
of the Siberian beaver, hunted not
for the fur but for the precious castoreum
or beaver-stone, to which such
great medical virtues are ascribed.
Attempts have been made in Germany
to obtain from the beavers of
that country a product which might
replace that of Siberia; but all in
vain. The fine quality is only to be
had in the far north, where, as Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Erman fancifully observes, nature
scatters animal perfumes in place of
fragrant flowers. "The Kosaks and
Russian traders have exalted the
beaver-stone into a panacea....
To the sentence, 'God arose, and
our enemies were scattered,' the
Siberians add, very characteristically,
the apocryphal interpolation, 'and
we are free from headache.' To ensure
this most desirable condition,
every one has recourse, at home or on
his travels, and with the firmest faith,
to two medicines, and only two, viz.,
beaver-stone, or beaver-efflux, as it is
here called, and sal-ammoniac." From
the strength of the castoreum, the
Siberians infer that other parts of the
animal must possess peculiar virtues.
Gouty swellings are said to subside
rapidly when rubbed with the fat,
and the beaver's teeth are popularly
believed to cure toothach.</p>

<p>The beaver is the only fur animal
in these latitudes that does not change
its colour in the course of the year.
This is probably owing to the circumstance,
that in winter it dwells wholly
in the water, thus enjoying a comparatively
equable temperature. In the
river Obi, at Beresov, the water does
not usually freeze below the depth of
four feet eight inches, and the beaver
always has two entrances to his dwelling,
one high on the bank above the
stream, the other below the freezing
limit. The architectural and wood-cutting
habits of the animal are the
same here as in America; but two
assertions, new to Mr Erman, were
made respecting it by the Beresov
hunters. He was assured that
"among beavers, as with bees and
men, there are distinctions of ranks;
each chief keeping a number of labourers,
the toils of which he oversees
and directs without taking part in
them; and, again, it was stated that
the contents of the castoreum bags depend
on the moon." It was impossible
to verify the veracity of these
two statements. As regards the
moon's influence, however, there is
ground for a suspicion that its advantages
are rather felt by the hunter,
than essential to the virtues of the
drug. Full moon is maintained, both
by Ostyaks and Russians, to be the
propitious time.</p>

<p>The most northern tribe of Ostyaks,
who dwell between the rivers Obi and
Yenisei, surpass their southern neighbours
in venatorial skill, as they, in
their turn, are surpassed by the
Samoyedes, who live in the northernmost
regions of Siberia. The men of
the Yenisei kill wolves, which, on account
of their long soft hair, are
reckoned greatly superior to the forest
and steppe wolves of middle Siberia.
They are also famed for their dexterity
in killing and capturing reindeer.
"Tying leathern cords between the
tops of the antlers of their tame deer,
they turn the animals loose, one by
one, in the neighbourhood of a wild
herd: these do not fail to attack the
strangers, and their antlers becoming
entangled in the cords during the contest,
they are held fast by the tame
deer till the men arrive. These
Ostyaks know also how to plant
spring-bows, which send the arrow
against the animal's breast." But
the Samoyedes, besides these ordinary
artifices, have other and ingenious
ways, peculiar to themselves, of ensnaring
and slaying the brute creation,
by putting themselves as much as
possible on an equality with the animals
pursued, going on all-fours, and
imitating them in voice and clothing.
The Polar bear is a common victim to
their cunning devices, and even to
their open attacks; for their intimate
acquaintance with the formidable
beast makes them regard him as an
easy prey. "The Samoyedes assert
that the white bear far exceeds the
black bear in ferocity and strength,
whilst fully equal to it in cunning; yet,
owing to his unwieldiness, they encounter
it without fear, and always
reckon on victory as certain. A man
will often go singly against a Polar bear,
eight feet long, without any other
weapon than his knife, which he fastens
to the end of a pole. In spring and
autumn these animals are found upon
the ice, near the hole, whence the seals
come forth to breathe. There the
bear covers himself up with snow,
facing the hole, and with one paw
stretched into the water." The Samoyede
seal-hunters imitate the bears,
and when the seal walks out upon the
ice, they shove a board over the hole
and capture the phoca. Concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the bear the Ostyaks entertain peculiar
notions, viewing it with a sort of
superstitious respect. "A member of
the court of justice told me that, in
suits between Russians and Ostyaks,
it is still the custom here (at Beresov)
to bring, into court the head of a bear,
and that this animal, which is supposed
to be omniscient, is there appealed
to as a witness by the Ostyaks.
In swearing, they make the gesture of
eating, and call upon the bear to devour
them in like manner if they do not tell
the truth." Some similar reverence
for Bruin exists, we believe, amongst
certain North American tribes.</p>

<p>The draught-dogs, so faithful and
useful to the northern Siberians, often
receive but scurvy treatment at their
masters' hands. The Ostyaks, who
are honesty personified, and who
laugh at the common European precautions
of locking up valuables and
bolting doors, cannot endure the predatory
propensities of their canine
allies, and fly into a passion whenever
an unlucky dog sneaks into their
dwelling in search of warmth or food.
The poor brute is immediately a mark
for the blows and kicks of every body
present, the storm of abuse being
justified by the cunning and greediness
of its object, who, if allowed to
abide in the house, would soon reduce
its inmates to short commons. There
is some excuse for the dogs' voracity,
however; for, according to Mr Erman's
account, they are considerably more
than half-starved, and are rarely admitted
to the fire to be fed, save when
they return weary and distressed from
a long journey. Severe as is the cold
in those regions, protection from it is
not essential to the existence, or even
to the health of these hardy dogs.
They sleep outside the houses, in holes
which they thaw in the snow by their
own warmth. At Obdorsk, where
there are no pastures, and consequently
no horses, four hundred dogs
are kept by sixty inhabitants, and each
of them is estimated to draw five poods'
(two hundred pounds) weight in the
loaded sledge. About eight o'clock in
the evening these four hundred brutes
set up a hideous howling, by way of
claiming their daily meal, consisting
invariably of fish, which, for them as
well as for their owners' consumption,
is first dried in the sun and then
pounded, bones and all. Except this
evening concert, a bark or a cry is
rarely uttered by these dogs, unless at
first starting when yoked to the sledge,
or on coming across a reindeer team
upon the road. Hydrophobia would
be a terrible scourge in this dog-district,
but the disease is fortunately
unknown there. Steller has stated
the same thing of the dogs of Kamschatka,
and Mr Erman concludes that
the malady is a result of the European
system of living in towns. And as the
Siberian dogs are so very moderately
fed, he infers that excess, not want,
generates the morbid habit. We are
inclined to attribute more importance
to the quality than to the quantity of
the food. A fish diet may be more
conducive to a wholesome state of the
animals' blood than the masses of
horse-flesh, paunch, and other rank
and unclean offal commonly given to
dogs in Europe, and especially in
England, where the carnivorous addictions
of the bipeds induce a belief in
the propriety of unlimited flesh-feeding
for quadrupeds.</p>

<p>The large annual importation of
exiles, the system of conscription,
and the advantages offered to public
officers volunteering for Siberian service,
are the most important and
efficacious measures by which Russia
proceeds gradually but steadily with
the colonisation and civilisation of
her Asiatic dominions. The conscripts
are sometimes drawn, not
only from Tobolsk, but from the remotest
parts of Siberia, and the term
of military service being twenty-eight
years, it is probable that only a small
proportion return to their native villages.
Those who do are looked up
to as oracles by their countrymen.
They are objects of pride to their
families and of respect to every body
else; the place of honour is theirs by
right, and they are addressed by the
title of Master Soldier.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The ferry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the Irtuish, by Tobolsk, whose
passage is considered the symbol of
political death to the numerous exiles
who each year cross it&mdash;bestows a
step of rank on all public servants
offering themselves for duty in Siberia
Proper. The passion for rank,
stronger in Russia than in any other
country, drives hosts of officers across
this important boundary; but as they
are not obliged to remain more than
three years, most of them return
home at the end of that time. Far
nearer to St Petersburg than the
Asiatic frontier, civilisation is still at
a very low ebb amongst the aboriginal
tribes. Close to Nijni Novgorod,
and within a very short distance of
Moscow, the prevailing population
consists of Cheremisses and Chuvashes,
two tribes many of whose
customs are nearly as barbarous as
their names. These people are shy
and timid, very slow in acquiring
industrious habits, and addicted to
sundry practices stamping them as
semi-savages. In some places they
cling to paganism, and offer up
horned beasts, fruit, and vegetables
to their various deities. The
Chuvash ladies wear a sort of bustle
of sheet copper, hanging from the
girdle backwards over the hips, and
having appended to it all manner of
metal ornaments, making a perpetual
clatter in walking. But these tribes
are the pink of refinement by comparison
with those in the northern
portion of the Muscovite empire,&mdash;with
the Ostyaks, who eat out of the same
trough with their dogs, or with the
Samoyedes who tear with their teeth,
and swallow with infinite relish, huge
lumps of raw and reeking flesh. The
women of the latter people wear, as their
favourite decoration, (certainly no inappropriate
one) a glutton's tail,
hanging down the back of their pelisse.
Their hair is plaited in tails, to which
all manner of lumber, brass and iron
rings, and rusty musket-locks, are
attached. Mr Erman's account of
"Life in the <i>Chum</i>" (the skin tent
of the Samoyedes) is quaint and
graphic.</p>

<p>"The reindeer calf, which we had
got on the way, was killed and cut up
in front of the tent a few minutes,
after our arrival. The men now
brought the bleeding flesh into the
tent, and began devouring it immediately,
quite raw, with the heartiest
appetite. The old man was satisfied
with sucking the brain from the head,
whilst each of our younger comrades
gnawed away at a limb of the animal,
even to the bone. They laughed at
the amazement which my good-humoured
Esthonian attendant expressed
at their blood-stained faces;
and when he gave them to understand,
through the interpreter, that
they were no better than wolves, they
seemed quite unprepared for such
reproof; replying gravely, that they
were at the same time no worse
than the wolves, since they shared
honestly with them, and left the bones
and some scraps of flesh merely for
their sake." In this same tent there
was a little monster of a boy named
Peina, whom one reads of with a sort
of shudder, and with a strong suspicion
that the creature was not <em>canny</em>.
Mr Erman himself seems to write of
him with peculiar reserve, stating
facts, but evidently unwilling to give
an opinion as to the exact nature of
the beast. Peina, who had first-rate
masticators, got his share of the raw
meat, which did not prevent his
drawing on his mother's lacteal resources,
and thumping her brutally
till she honoured the draft, or
handed him the pot-ladle, with which
he supped scalding porridge to his
great internal contentment. The
travellers' bread, although frozen
hard and not easy eating for adult
jaws, disappeared by wholesale within
those of Peina. At night the
anomalous urchin was laid naked in
a canoe-shaped basket, and covered
up so thickly with furs that his cries
seemed to come from the depths of
the earth. In the morning his
mother took him from his bed and
set him up, still naked, before the fire
to warm himself. Sugar, when first
presented to him, he called snow, and
threw away, but when once he had
tasted the dainty, his demands for it
were unceasing and peremptory.
Taking into consideration the uncomfortable
and uncleanly peculiarities of
the Samoyedes, both young and old,
we cannot feel surprised that Mr
Erman's interpreter conceived an intense
dislike to their society, and so
managed matters that one morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
whilst the man of science was busy
measuring a base-line to ascertain
the heights of some mountains, his
Samoyede companions suddenly disappeared
with their tent and their
reindeer, leaving him with three ill-equipped
sledges and a few Ostyak
attendants, and with no choice but to
make the best of his way back to
Obdorsk, whence he soon afterwards
returned to Tobolsk. There he
passed his Christmas, and then resumed
his journey; but this time in a
southerly direction. After having
penetrated to sixty-seven degrees
north, the region of eternal frost, he
struck southwards to the latitude of
the Land's End, making a dip into
China, which furnishes some of the
best chapters in his book.</p>

<p>Irkutsk, the last town of importance
north of the Chinese frontier, consists
of nineteen hundred houses, fifty being
of brick, and the remainder of wood,
and is probably the cheapest place in
the civilised world as regards articles
of food. We say "civilised," because,
although situate in a barbarous region,
and possessing a population of a very
motley character, the town has much
that is European in its aspect and
usages. It possesses an exchange,
government factories, where newly-arrived
convicts are employed, a
school of medicine, a gymnasium, and
a handsome parade-ground. In the
market, formed of wooden booths, the
stores of food were enormous. Beef
cost about a halfpenny a pound; of
flour one penny would purchase nearly
eight and a half pounds; partridges
and heathfowl were sold at five
farthings a-piece. But we are in
haste to get amongst the Celestials.
First comes a gallop across More
Baikal, a large lake just beyond
Irkutsk, on which the Russian government
maintains an armed flotilla.
This gallop is a fine bit of helter-skelter,
over ice brilliant as glass.
"There was no snow upon the ice, so
that its surface shone like a polished
mirror in the moonlight. The horses
that were put under our sledges in
Kadilnaya had to be held on each side
till the very moment of starting, when
they broke at once into full gallop,
which they kept up till we landed on
the further shore. We completed
seven German miles in two hours and
a quarter, undoubtedly the most extraordinary
as well as the most
speedy stage upon any route in Russia."
Thence, onwards to the frontier line.
"We followed the crowd that pressed
forward towards a narrow door in the
front of a long wooden building.
This admitted us into the inner quadrangle
of a Russian warehouse. A corresponding
door, at the opposite side of
this court, opens just upon a wooden
barricade, which constitutes the barrier
of China. In this there is a
wide portal, ornamented with pillars,
and displaying the Russian
eagle above it, along with the cipher
of the reigning emperor, Nicholas
the First, by whom it was erected."
On passing through this gate, the
change is immediate and striking,&mdash;from
Russian sobriety of aspect and
hue to the gaudy finery of China.
Maimachen, the name of the Chinese
town visited by Mr Erman, has a very
masquerading air to a European eye.
The walls on either side of the streets
do not look like house walls, the roofs
being flat and invisible from the street.
"Indeed, they are nearly altogether
concealed by the gay-coloured paper
lanterns and flags, with inscriptions
on them, hung out on both sides of
the way. Cords, with similar scrolls
and lanterns, are likewise stretched
from roof to roof across the street.
These dazzling decorations stand out
in glaring contrast with the dull yellow
of the ground and walls. In the open
crossings of the streets, which intersect
each other at right angles, stood
enormous chafing-dishes of cast-iron,
like basins, upon a slender pedestal
four feet in height. The benches by
which they were surrounded were
occupied by tea-drinkers, who sat
smoking from the little pipes they
carry at their girdles, whilst their
kettles boiled at the common fire."
Mr Erman had the good fortune to be
on the frontier at the period of the
Chinese festival of the White Moon,
which is in fact the celebration of the
new-year, and he had the still
greater luck to be invited to share
in it at Maimachen. He found the
town in its gayest costume. The expenditure
of flags and lanterns was
prodigious. The scrolls usually contained
the names of the families before
whose houses they were hung out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
coupled with words of auspicious import,
as gladness, riches, wisdom, &amp;c.
There was a great firing of crackers
and rockets, partly to celebrate the
day, but chiefly in honour of the
guests. Before dinner the latter were
diverted by a theatrical representation.
Maimachen boasts a regular
company of actors, and upon this
great occasion they did their best.
Their orchestra was of a rather violent
description, consisting of "wooden
drums, shaped like casks, brass cymbals,
and plates of the same metal,
or gongs, held by a string and beaten
with knockers, and wooden truncheons,
of different sizes, which they used as
castanets." There were no actresses;
but the deficiency was not to be detected,
the younger and more delicate
men personating women to the life by
the aid of wigs and long tresses of
black hair, but especially by curls
pressed flat upon the forehead. Masks
were not used, but paint was in abundance;
in some cases with a view to
represent spectacles, mustachios, &amp;c.;
in others to conceal the human features,
or give them a monstrous aspect. "One
face was covered with coloured rays,
issuing from the mouth. The same
actor had also a feather on his head&mdash;in
Chinese comedy the conventional
mark of a ghost or apparition. Another
wore a golden helmet, which
constituted him a warrior. Several
kept beating themselves incessantly
on the hip with a cane, and by so
doing intimated that they were on
horseback." The play itself was more
like a game of romps than any regular
dramatic representation. Little was
said; but, on the other hand, there was
a deal of dancing, drumming, and
running about. Mr Erman could make
neither head nor tail of the proceedings.
By way of experiment, however,
he made some tender gestures
to one of the pseudo-ladies, who acknowledged
them in the most amiable
manner, and after that the horsemen
without horses paid him much attention,
pointing with their sticks to his
spectacles, and trying to touch them
as they passed. All this greatly diverted
the Mongol audience, evidently
delighted to see a real counterpart to
the painted spectacles of some of the
actors.</p>

<p>The play over, Mr Erman and the
other guests, preceded by the uproarious
orchestra, marched off to dinner
at the house of the sarguchei or chief
officer of Maimachen. This gentleman,
a tall, thin person of stern countenance,
dressed in gray velvet, had a
white button on the crown of his
black felt hat, indicating his rank, and
a chalcedony ring, an inch wide, upon
his right-hand thumb, this being a
mark of official dignity. "His nails,"
says our traveller, "did not extend
above half an inch beyond the tips of
his fingers, his personal vanity being
in this respect subdued, as might be
expected in a man of sober mind and
mature years." The man of short
nails and sober mind was exceeding
hospitable, welcomed his guests in a
soft and sonorous voice, and sat down
with them to dinner at tables covered
with scarlet cloth. The regale that
followed might have caused a European
<em>chef</em> to pale his ineffectual fires
from sheer envy. It began, oddly
enough, with fruits, sweetmeats, and
tea. These discussed, a piece of fine
paper, for a napkin, and a pair of
ivory chopsticks, were laid before each
guest, and the tables, which were six
feet wide, were covered over thickly
with small porcelain plates full of all
manner of complicated edibles. Fat
abounded in the dressing, to neutralise
which weak vinegar was used. The
first series of saucers duly honoured,
a second was brought in and put on
the top of its predecessor. Others
followed, and as the previous stratum
was never removed, there soon arose
upon the table a lofty pile of gastronomical
curiosities. Pipes and <i>chowsen</i>,
a Chinese spirit distilled from rice,
concluded the feast, as the strangers
thought;&mdash;but they were vastly mistaken.
The soup course had still to
come, and that was followed by an
infusion of cabbage-leaves, drawn out
of an urn by a cock, and drunk steaming
hot. How a dinner commencing
with preserved apricots, and concluding
with cabbage water, agreed with
German stomachs, Mr Erman does
not inform us. After managing to
taste upwards of a hundred dishes, he
went to visit the temple of Fo, whose
court was guarded by two clay lions
painted green, whilst at his shrine
were deposited, on account of the
festive season, a prodigious heap of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
delicacies. Whole sheep without the
skin, plucked chickens, pheasants, and
guinea-fowls, in their natural positions,
and glistening with fat, lay in
hillocks at the feet of half-a-dozen
grotesque and indecent idols. On a
long table, a wall of offerings was
built up, consisting of dressed meat
and cakes of every kind, the whole
surrounded with an elaborate lattice-work
of white dough, five or six feet
high, the openings of which were
filled with dried fruits and confectionary
of the finest kind. Perfumed
candles burned before the disgusting
idols, and brass discs hung from the
ceiling, and were struck with clappers
when any bearing offerings approached.</p>

<p>The contents of the shops at Maimachen
gave Mr Erman a very high
opinion of Chinese skill and ingenuity.
He saw scientific instruments of great
merit, very clever clockwork, paintings
drawn and finished with the
greatest care, (although highly objectionable
by the indelicacy of their
subjects,) porcelain, sculpture, bowls,
vases, and figures of various kinds of
stone. "There were large spherical
bowls, and oval vases, of chalcedony
and agate, and reliefs cut in cornelians,
nephrit, and other coloured
stones. Of the latter kind, the most
common are flowers, the several parts
of which are formed of various and
tastefully selected stones, and then
cemented with mastic on a foundation
of stone. For many of these articles,
highly elaborate, and at the same
time quite useless, the merchants of
Maimachen asked four thousand tea-bricks,
(a standard of currency,) or
about two thousand five hundred
Russian dollars. In this we saw a
proof of luxury and profuse expenditure
amongst the Chinese. Many
other branches of industry indicated
enervation and effeminacy of manners:"
musk, for instance, and other
perfumes, enclosed in little bags, and
considered indispensable appendages
to a young man's dress. A curious
plaything, considered equally essential,
is composed of two polished balls,
about an inch in diameter, which the
men always carry with them. "These
are taken in the right hand, at idle
times, and rolled and rubbed one over
the other with the fingers; the noise
they make amuses, and perhaps there
is something agreeable also in the
feel of them. Here, in Maimachen, I
saw some of these balls made of glass,
striped green and white, and, hollow,
containing within them a little lump
of clay, which rattled with every
motion." The musk and perfumes,
however abundantly used, are all
insufficient to counteract a very peculiar
and unpleasant smell attributed
by Mr Erman to the Chinese. He
first perceived it at the theatre, and
took it to arise from an inordinate
addiction to leeks on the part of
actors and audience, whose breath
and clothes were infected with the
disagreeable odour of that bulb. But
he was subsequently induced to regard
it as a national taint, a Chinese exhalation,
not to be overcome by any
amount of artificial perfume, and
whose cause is matter of inquiry for
the chemist. Doubtless the Chinese
would get rid of it, were it possible so
to do, for the care they bestow on
personal beauty and elegance is very
great. Another striking defect in the
inhabitants of Maimachen is to be
found in their black and decayed
teeth. The cause of this Mr Erman
suspects to be the solution of copper,
produced by the empyreumatic oil of
tobacco in the bronze mouth-pieces
of their pipes.</p>

<p>At a post-house upon his road back
to Irkutsk, Mr Erman and his party
were met by a deputation from no
less a personage than the Khamba
Lama, the high-priest of the Buraets,
a Mongolian tribe closely allied in
language and customs to the natives
of the northern provinces of China.
The embassy consisted of four lamas
or priests attired in scarlet robes and
bright yellow hats. They brought
an invitation to a grand festival,
which was readily accepted,&mdash;and a
very remarkable business it proved to
be. The discordant theatrical music
at Maimachen was a mere trifle compared
to the monstrous noise made
by the Buraet kettle-drums, so large
that they were dragged upon four
wheels, and by copper trumpets ten
feet long, borne by one man and
blown by another. "The grave prelude
of the wind instruments was like
a roaring hurricane, and the chorus
of brass gongs, drums, &amp;c., resembled
the crash of a falling mountain." In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
this place we find some curious and
interesting details respecting the
Buddhist religion and priesthood,
after which Mr Erman returns to
Irkutsk, and resumes his journey
eastward, through the valley of the
Lena, to the land of the Tunguzes
and Yakuts. The chief town of the
latter people, Yakutsk, is two degrees
to the south of Beresov, which Mr Erman
had visited on his way to Obdorsk;
but, nevertheless, the cold is far more
severe at the former place, where
frozen earth is found near the surface
all the year round, and the same condition
of the ground continues to the
depth of six hundred feet. "The
inhabitants of the Swiss Alps would
not unjustly think themselves lost if
they were compelled to live at the
height of ten thousand feet, or two
thousand three hundred feet above
the hospital of the great St Bernard,
and there to support and clothe themselves
by keeping cattle, and with the
productions of the surrounding mountains;
yet they would then, and not
until they arrived at that height, be
settled on ground having the same
temperature which I found here
amongst the Yakuts, who are rich
in cattle. It would seem, therefore,
as if that succeeded in Siberia which
was impossible in Europe, if we did
not take into account that the same
constant temperature of the ground
may be made up at different places of
very different elements." Notwithstanding
the severity of their climate
and resistance of their frozen soil, the
Yakuts are a prosperous people, having
attained a considerable degree of
civilisation, and amongst whom crime
is rare, although the influence of
Russian example and contact daily
renders it less so. There is much
interest in Mr Erman's account of
them, and of the wandering Tunguzses,
the last tribe with whom he consorted
before his arrival at Okhotsk. Here
his reception was not very flattering.
"We were looked at with much
curiosity from all the house-doors on
the way, for the devout elders of the
place had been filled with anxious
forebodings by the accounts of the
arrival of a foreigner. They signed
themselves with the cross whenever
he was mentioned. And I learned
to-day that they had fears of war,
conscription, and other calamities."
Nor was their alarm abated by learning
that "the heathen foreigner wore
snow-shades (spectacles) even in thick
weather, and that he carried a dog in
the sledge with him. Thus the return
to civilised man was marked in the
first instance by the encounter of
intolerant superstition, and it was
necessary to forget the nobler traits
of the wilderness before we could
become reconciled to the Russians of
Okhotsk." At which place Mr Erman's
narrative ceases. We await with
interest its promised continuation&mdash;an
account of his adventures in Kamschatka,
California, and the Pacific.</p>

<p>We would that, like stout Lord
Percy of yore, it were in our power at
this present moment to chronicle a
vow that we should forthwith take
our pastime for three summer days on
the pleasant hills of Scotland. Alas
for us, that we are doomed, from
divers causes, to absent ourselves from
felicity awhile, and, amidst the heat
and noise of London, listen with intense
disgust to the brutal bayings of
the Chartists! This very night, we
hear, the ignoble hunt is to be up in
Bishop Bonner's fields. Crowds of
dirty, unshaven, squalid ruffians, who
have not the strength to use the pike,
but the will to employ the knife of the
assassin&mdash;fellows whom even Cobden
would be chary to recognise as his
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quondam</i> supporters, defenders, and
dupes&mdash;not unmingled with foreign
propagandists, whom even France, in
the fury of her revolutionary tornado,
repudiates&mdash;are thronging to the place
of rendezvous, where, doubtless, their
souls will be worthily regaled by the
ravings of some rascally vendors of
sedition, blasphemy, and treason. Then
will ensue the usual scene which for
nights has disgraced the metropolis.
Some unfortunate tradesman, whose
curiosity has been stronger than his
prudence, will be fixed upon as a
"special" or a spy&mdash;the cowards, presuming
upon their numbers, and the
apparent absence of all executive
power, will attempt a deliberate murder&mdash;the
police will sally from their
hiding-place to the rescue&mdash;there will
be a storm of brickbats, a determined
charge with the baton, a shop or two
will be gutted, some score of craniums
cracked, and to-morrow morning the
greasy patriots, at the bar of Bow
Street, will read their recantation, and,
in the face of overwhelming evidence
to the contrary, protest their loyalty
to the Queen. Such are the pastimes
of merry England in the month of
June, and such the results of that
enlightened policy which yields every
thing to popular clamour, adopts the
most fatal delusions as distinct principles
of right, and then shrinks, trembling
and aghast, from the inevitable
result of their development!</p>

<p>We do not want&mdash;in this article, at
least&mdash;to be political, and we vow that
we took up our pen three minutes ago
in a spirit of perfect good-will and
harmony towards all manner of men.
But the hoarse bawling of these cannibals
has somewhat ruffled our temper,
dispelled for the moment our dreams
of the mountains, and forced us back
to the sterner realities of popular
tumult and the truncheon. If this
sort of thing lasts, we shall indubitably
emigrate. Assassination, as recommended
by the modern Hamilcar,
is by no manner of means to our
taste. Our opinion coincides with
that of the gracious Captain of Knockdunder,
and, were we promoted to a
judicial function, "the chiel they ca'
the Fustler" should ere long fustle in
a tow. Neither are we at all disposed
to fraternise with the milder Cuffey&mdash;a
fellow, by the way, who is not without
some redeeming scintillations of
humour. We have no wish to be
introduced to him even at a mesmeric
soiree; and, acting upon the principle
of Jacquey, we shall pray heaven to
decrease our acquaintance, and put
the Tweed as speedily as possible between
ourselves and the partisans of
O'Connor. We hope the Lord Provost,
though discomfited in his Police
Bill, has been looking after the tranquillity
of the Calton. If not, we
must move further north, and finally
locate ourselves somewhere in the
vicinity of Dalnacardoch. The
deuce is in it, if the revolutionary
mania has penetrated to that sequestred
region! No son of the mountains
has ever yet given in his adhesion to
the Charter&mdash;treason hath not stained
the tartan, and no republican pins
have ever been exposed beneath the
checkered margin of the kilt. There
is loyalty at least in the land which
was traversed by Montrose and Dundee;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and without the slightest fear
that any of the numerous points of
that interesting but incomprehensible
public document, which Mr Joseph
Hume proposes to condense, shall be
unduly obtruded on our notice, we
shall at once exchange our London
dwelling for the more pleasant bothy
of the hills.</p>

<p>As for a companion, we shall seek
none better&mdash;for we could not find
one&mdash;than this last publication of the
Stuarts. And here, once for all, let
us draw a line of distinction betwixt
the poetry and the prose of these very
remarkable brothers. We have not
the remotest intention of sitting in
judgment on the "Lays," or of testing
the poetical merits of John Sobieski
and Charles Edward, either
by the canons of Longinus, or by
that superior code of literary laws
which Maga has promulgated to the
world. The poems, which occupy
exclusively the first of these volumes,
are, with one exception, fugitive in
their nature, and appear to have been
penned rather from occasional impulse,
than from any deliberate intention of
publication. Accordingly, we find that
most of them relate to topics personal
to the authors themselves&mdash;and with
these we do not meddle. In others,
there are flashes of the deep national
spirit which still survives&mdash;though our
rulers do not seem to mark it&mdash;in
Scotland: indignation at the neglect
with which too many of our national
institutions have been treated, and
mournful lamentings over the misfortunes
of a former age. But the impulse
which leads to the composition
of poetry does not always imply
its accomplishment. Poetry, as an
art in which excellence can only be
obtained by a combination of the
simple and the sublime, requires a
study far more intense and serious
than the mere critic is apt to allow.
In a former Number we devoted an
article to an exposition of those principles,
which are absolutely invariable
in their application, and which must
be thoroughly understood, if they are
not intuitive to the poet; and, being
in no mood for repetition, we shall
simply say that we adhere to our
recorded doctrines. The Stuarts, it
must be confessed, are more successful
with the rifle than the lyre. We
would far rather meet them in the
garb of the forester, than in the more
fantastic fashion of the minstrel: be
theirs the lot of Ryno the hunter, not
the darkened destiny of the bard.</p>

<p>Do, therefore, what you please with
the first volume&mdash;pack it up in your
portmanteau, or place it on the shelf
beside Chambers' History and the
collections of good old Bishop Forbes.
But if you profess to be a deer-stalker&mdash;though
we fear your profession to
be false&mdash;or if you are but an aspiring
neophyte, and hankerer after that
proud position&mdash;or if you merely
bound your aspirations towards the
compassing of the death of a roebuck&mdash;or
if simply you have a keen and a
kindly eye for nature, and are a lover
of the sylvan solitudes&mdash;in one or
other, or all of these characters, we
pray you to deal more leisurely with
the other tone, which is the Hunter's
Vade-Mecum, the best guide ever yet
published to the haunts of the antlered
monarch.</p>

<p>We are fond of Mr Scrope, and
we have an excessive partiality for
St John. Two finer fellows never
shouldered a rifle; and our conscience
does not accuse us of having used too
superlative, in epithet in their praise.
This was the more creditable on our
part, because we knew them both to
be Southrons; and while freely admitting
the sportsman-like qualities
of the one, and the strong picturesque
style and spirit of the other, we felt a
slight, passing, but pardonable pang
of jealousy, that they should have
stepped in, and pre-occupied the
native field. Where, thought we, are
our Scottish deer-stalkers? Can the
lads not handle a pen as well as
touch a trigger? Will none of them,
who have been trained to the hills
since they were striplings, stand
forth for the honour of Albyn, and
try a match with these fustian-coated
circumventers of the stag? By the
shade of Domhnull Mac-Fhionnlaidlhnan
Dan, we blush for the literary
reputation of our country, and almost
wish that we were young enough
ourselves to take the hill against the
invading Sassenach! At length&mdash;and
we are delighted to see it&mdash;the reproach
has been swept away. Two
stalwart champions of the forest have
risen in the persons of the Stuarts&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
have encountered the Englishmen
with their own weapons, and, in
our opinion, beaten them hollow.</p>

<p>Mr Scrope had the merit of producing
the earliest work in which deer-stalking
was treated as a distinct and
peculiar branch of the art venatory.
We speak of it now from recollection;
for our copy, somewhat frayed and
worn by the fingers of ambitious
sportsmen, is in the snug corner of a
library some hundred miles to the
northward. But we remember well
the Waltonian character of the book&mdash;the
professional style in which the
elder practitioner enforced his precepts
upon the dawning intellect of his
companion; and the adventures,
neither few nor feeble, which were
depicted in the heart of the Atholl
forest. Taken as the production of
an English sportsman, Mr Scrope's
book is highly creditable: considered
as the manual of a deer-stalker, it is
at the best indifferent. Nor, indeed,
could it well be otherwise. Not until
middle age, if we are informed rightly,
did Mr Scrope first send a ball into
the ample shoulder of a hart: his
young blood never beat tumultuously
in his veins at the sight of the mighty
creature rolling over upon the heather,
and its antlers buried in the moss.
His boyish enthusiasm, we fear, was
expended upon game of less mark and
likelihood&mdash;partridges, perchance, as
they whirred from the turnips, or
possibly he was "entered" with the
hare. Wordsworth's maxim, that the
boy is the father of the man, is peculiarly
applicable in sporting matters.
Upon the character of the country in
which the latent spirit of the hunter
is earliest developed, depends, in a
great degree, his future success, and
certainly his accomplishment as an
Orion. The young squire, who has
been brought up in the faith of Sykes,
who never stirs abroad without a
keeper, and who is accustomed to see
his delicate pointers execute their
manœuvres with almost mathematical
precision on the flat stubbles of Norfolk,
labours under a huge disadvantage
in the higher branches of his
science, compared with the Highland
boy who has received his education
on the hill. What though the single
barrel of the latter be a clumsy implement
indeed in competition with the
Purdie which decorates the shoulder
of the former&mdash;though the hound that
sometimes attends him, though oftener
he is alone, never slept a single night
in a kennel, and is the ruggedest specimen
of his kind&mdash;still he is in the
enjoyment of advantages incomparably
superior for the development of
all his faculties, and the sharpening of
every sense. The triumph of the
sportsman does not lie so much in the
killing as in the finding of his game.
Were it otherwise, the pigeon-slayer
of Battersea or the Red-house would
have just claims to the honours of Sir
Tristram, and the annihilator of
poultry to rank with the Nimrods of
the world. Our young friend the
Squire shoots well&mdash;that is to say, he
can kill with reasonable precision:
but, after all, what is he save an instrument?
Take Ponto away from
him, tie up Juno, send a bullet through
the brain of Basta, and a pretty beggarly
account you will have of it in
the evening when we come to the
emptying of the bags! Or lead him
down to the sea-shore, and show him
a whaup, which in the English tongue
is denominated a curlew; request him
to use all his possible skill to compass
possession of the bird; but do not set
your heart on having it, else, as sure
as fate, you are doomed to disappointment.
Whaup is quite alive to his
own interests, and by no means unsuspicious
of the Saxon, who advances
straight towards him with a hypocritical
air of unconcern. Had the
Highland lad been there, what a difference!
He would have dropped like
a stone behind that rock, wriggled
like a serpent over the sand, kept the
bird between himself and the sea,
taken advantage of every inequality
in the ground, discerned from the
attitude of his quarry whether its
suspicions were aroused or not, and
in ten minutes a pluff of white smoke
and a report would have announced
its extermination. As it is, the curlew
remains apparently unconcerned until
the Lord of the Manor has reduced
the intermediate distance to a hundred
and twenty yards, and then, with a
shrill whistle, takes flight along the
margin of the tide. Or set him to
stalk a blackcock, perched high of an
Autumn morning on a dyke. How
clumsily he sets about it! how miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
is his stoop! how wretchedly he
calculates his distance! That wide-awake
hat, which, for the sake of
symmetry, he has been pleased to
surmount with a feather, is as conspicuous
to the country for miles round,
and of course to the blackcock, as
was the white plume of Murat in the
field of battle, and as potent to effect
a clearance, of which we presently
have ocular demonstration.</p>

<p>We contend, therefore, that it is extremely
difficult for the man, be he ever
so addicted to field-sports, who has been
educated in a cultivated country, to
disembarrass himself of the artificial
habits which he is tolerably sure to acquire.
His trolling may be excellent&mdash;indeed,
English gentlemen are, generally
speaking, first-rate shots&mdash;but he
will be deficient in the science of the naturalist,
and in that singular acuteness
of perception which can hardly be
gained save by an early intimacy with
nature, on the mountain, the moor, or in
the glen. No subsequent education or
experience can make up for the normal
deficiency, least of all in the pursuit
of an animal so wary, so instinctive,
and so peculiar in its habits as the
deer. Of course we do not mean to
deny that there is much which may
be learned. What a pointer is to
partridges, some wary and experienced
forester may often be made to the
deer; and if you put yourself under
his tuition, and scrupulously obey his
orders, you may very possibly succeed
in attaining the object of your desires.
Nor indeed can you do better, up to a
certain point, notwithstanding the
strictures of the Stuarts, who are, we
think, unnecessarily wroth at the
system which would call in the aid
of any supplementary assistance. We
hope no gentleman who has rented a
forest for the ensuing season will be
deterred from following the feet of a
Highland Gamaliel on account of any
ridicule which may be attached to the
fact of his having been "taken up"
to a deer. If he should rashly attempt
stalking at his own hand, without any
preliminary instruction, we should be
sorry to found our hopes of dinner on
the chance of his acquisition of a
haunch.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When advancing upon deer [say
our authors]&mdash;except in strange ground&mdash;the
forester, or any other attendant,
should be left behind a stone, or in
some covert, before the stalker commences
his approach; not from any
recognition of the false reproach made
against the guides by Mr Scrope, but
because there is no occasion for an assistant,
and the action of one has more
celerity, independence, and security from
discovery, than when a greater number
are in motion. The charge made by the
author of 'The Art of Deer-stalking,'
that the forester is often in the way, and
sometimes obstructs the shot, is not true,
unless in instances of inexperienced and
awkward individuals, who are not to be
found among that class of foresters of
whom the guest of the <em>Atholl Forest</em> proposes
his remarks. With a MacKenzie,
or a MacDonald, a Catanach, and a MacHardie,
the asserted inconvenience must
proceed from the ignorance or maladroitness
of the gray worm which crawls
at his back, and who often does not know
what he is doing, or where he is going,
with his ideas <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">égaré</i> on his sensitive
knees and varnished Purdie, unconscious
of what he ought to do and nervous for
what he ought not, flurried with eagerness
and disgusted with his posture, and
who, never seeing a deer except once in
the year, is led up to him like a 'blind
burraid,' by one whose language he
scarcely understands. In general, therefore,
the embarrassments of the 'creep'
are those of the superior, who is frequently
so ignorant, unpractised, and
dependent upon the guidance of the forester,
that to be '<em>taken up to the deer</em>'
has become the modern forest phrase for
the approach of the sportsman. This contemptible
term, and its contemptible practice,
has only been introduced within the
last quarter century, since the prevalence
of stalking gentlemen utterly unacquainted
with the ground and pursuit of deer.
Of old, the '<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Seàlgair uasal nam bèann</i>'
was initiated to the hill when yet but a
'<i>biorach</i>' of a stalker; and when he
became a matured hill-man, he should no
more have suffered himself to be&mdash;'<em>taken
up</em> to his deer' by an attendant, than a
Melton fox-hunter to be trained after the
hounds by a whipper-in with a leading
rein.&mdash;What should have been the sentiments
of the old chiefs and Uaislean of
the last century&mdash;the Dukes of Atholl
and Gordon&mdash;Glengarrie&mdash;John Aberardar&mdash;Iain
dubh Bhail-a-Chroäin&mdash;to hear
a deer-hunter speak of being '<em>taken up
to his deer</em>!'&mdash;Certainly that he was
a noble 'amadan' or 'gille-crùbach,'
who had not the faculties or the limbs to
act for himself.&mdash;But this is only one of
the many instances for which the hills of
Gael may mourn with the mountains of
Gilboa&mdash;'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quomodo ceciderunt robusti!</i>'"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Far are we from insinuating that
Mr Scrope is at all liable to the remarks
contained in the foregoing
extract. On the contrary, we hold
him to be a man of vigorous mind
and acute eye, and any thing but a
contemptible foe to the stags, after the
measure of his own experience. If he
is deficient at all, it is in the poetry
and higher mysteries of the art, which
hardly would be expected from a
stranger, whose initiation was necessarily
late. Waverley, though a respectable
shot, and a man of literary
taste, would, we apprehend, have
described the driving and disposition
of the tainchel less effectively, and
certainly far less truly, than Fergus
M'Ivor; so great a difference is there
betwixt the craft of the master and
his pupil. Let Mr Scrope, therefore,
rest content with the laurels he has
won, and the trophies he has taken
from the forest. Not unforgotten is
his name in Atholl, nor unloved. Let
him be a guide to the Southren, but
he must not dream of rivalling the
Stuarts in woodcraft, or Stoddart in
the science of piscation.</p>

<p>Of Mr St John's "Wild Sports of the
Highlands," we have already spoken
in terms of unqualified praise. A
more delightful volume was never
adapted for the pocket of the sportsman:
a more truthful or observant
work has seldom issued from the pen
of the naturalist. His sketches and
pictures of deer-stalking we allow to
be as perfect in their way as the compositions
of Landseer; and having
said so much, we shall not make any
further call upon that gentleman's
blushes. Still, even his experience is
limited, and his knowledge imperfect.
He has given us a brilliant account
of his own exploits upon the hill, but
he has not lived long enough in the
wilder haunts of the deer accurately
to understand their habits. Not so
our authors, who for years have been
denizens of the mountains, speaking
the tongue of the Gael, wearing the
native garb, and following the chase
with an ardour and enthusiasm unparalleled
in these degenerate days.</p>

<p>Gentlemen who complain of the inferior
accommodation afforded by some
of the more distant hostelries of Scotland&mdash;who
are shocked at the absence
of warming-pans, and tremulously
nervous about your sanatory condition,
when subjected to the enormity of
damp sheets&mdash;how would you like to
spend a few nights on the misty hill-side,
or even in the hut of the hunters?
We shall take you if you please to the
latter spot, merely premising that, in
order to reach it, we must cross the
Findhorn, now roaring down in spate.
A terrible stream is that Findhorn, as
Mr St John well knows; but we
question whether he ever ventured to
ford it on the rise, as was done by one
of the Stuarts. For the information
of distant friends, we beg to put our
imprimatur to the following description
of this furious Highland flood,
which rolled between the residence of
the hunters and their favourite
ground.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That stream, however, which was so
calm, and bright, and sunny, when the
otters floated down its current in a still
summer's morning, was a fierce and
terrible enemy in its anger; and, for a
great part of the year, the dread of its
uncertainty and danger was a formidable
cause for the preservation of that profound
solitude of the forest which so long
made it the sanctuary of deer, roe, and
every kind of wild game. The rapidity
with which the river comes down, the
impassable height to which it rises in an
incredibly short time, its incertitude and
fury, would render it an object of care
to bold forders and boatmen; but with
the peasants of the 'laich,' unaccustomed,
like the Highlanders, to wrestle
with a mountain torrent, and, excepting
in rare instances, unable to swim or
manage a coble, it inspires a dread, almost
amounting to awe, and none except
ourselves ventured to keep a boat above
the fishing-station of Slui. Pent within
a channel of rocks from fifty to a hundred
and eighty feet in height, the rise
of the water is rapidly exaggerated by
the incapability of diffusion; and the
length of its course sometimes concealing
beyond the horizon the storms by which
it is swelled at its source, its floods then
descend with unexpected violence. Frequently
when, excepting a low wreath
upon Beann-Drineachain, the sun is shining
in a cloudless sky, and the water
scarce ripples over the glittering ford, a
deep hollow sound&mdash;a dull approaching
roar may be heard in the gorges of the
river; and almost before the wading
fisherman can gain the shore, a bank of
water, loaded with trees, and rocks, and
wreck, will come down three&mdash;four&mdash;five
feet abreast&mdash;sweeping all before it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in a thunder of foam and ruin. In
ordinary cases, after two days of rain,
the stream will rise twenty or thirty feet&mdash;it
<em>has</em> risen nearly ten fathoms in its
rocky gulf; and once upon this occasion
it mounted fifteen feet in a quarter of an
hour. When the dawn broke, it appeared
sweeping through the trees, which the
evening before hung fifty feet above its
brink&mdash;a black roaring tempest loaded
with ruins and debris, from which were
seen to rise at times the white skeletons
of trees peeled of their bark, beams and
couples of houses&mdash;a cart&mdash;a door&mdash;a
cradle, hurrying and tilting through the
foam and spray, like the scattered 'floatsome'
of a wreck.</p>

<p>"It may be judged how far it was convenient
in winter to hunt a forest separated
by such a boundary, of which the
nearest certain passage was by a bridge
two miles to the west, with frequently
the view of hunting three miles to the
east. Often we have gone out in a clear
sapphire morning, when there was scarce
a ripple on the pools, and the water on
the ford was not over our 'glunachan,'
and when we returned at evening, and
approached through the dark veil of pines
which descended to the river, have heard
a roar as if the world was rolling together
down the black trough before us, and
as we came out on the bank, found a furious
tempest of water, tumbling, and
plunging, and leaping, over stock and
rock twenty feet upon the clatach, where
we had left it whimpering among the
pebbles in the morning; while, in the
far, deep, birch-embowered channel, where
the stream was then so still and placid
that you could only guess its course by
the bright glistening eye which here and
there blinked between the trees and
stones,&mdash;now it came yelling, and skirling,
and clamouring down the rocks and
falls, as if all the air was full of gibbering,
babbling, laughing demons, who were
muttering, and yammering, and prophesying,
and hooting, at what you were going
to do, if you attempted to cross."</p></blockquote>

<p>We pray you at your leisure to
read on, and you will presently see
what peril our authors underwent at
the fearful fords of the Findhorn.
Once or twice in our life we have
been in similar jeopardy, and we can
testify with unction to the singular
sensations which beset a man in the
midst of a roaring river, when the
rapids are shooting away below, and
the boulder-stones rolling beneath
his feet. We pass over some perilous
instances of adventure, which at
length became so frequent as to lead
to the construction of the hut.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Such continually and unexpectedly
were the ferries of the Findhorn, and
many such escapes we had, in daylight
and in darkness.&mdash;Twice I have been
swamped, often nearly upset, and more
than once carried off my legs in the fords;
and&mdash;I say it with humility, and always
under the mercy of heaven&mdash;that I owed
rescue either to actual swimming, or to
the confidence inspired by that power
when struggling with the strong and
terrible enemy.</p>

<p>"This continual exposure to battle and
disappointment, however, became at
length too vexatious an abridgment of
sport and certainty; and as I would&mdash;and
often&mdash;have made my bed under a
fir tree rather than go round by the
bridge of Daltullich, I resolved upon
another alternative&mdash;to build in the forest
a '<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">bothan an t-sealgair</i>,' or 'hunter's
hut,' where we might lodge for the night
when it was impossible to cross the
water.</p>

<p>"There is a high and beautiful craig at
the crook of the river near the 'Little
Eas,'&mdash;a precipice eighty feet in height,
and then like a vast stone helmet crowned
with a feathery plume of wood, which
nodded over its brow. From its top you
might drop a bullet into the pool below,
but on the south side there is an accessible
woody bank, down which, by planting
your heels firmly in the soil and
among the roots of the trees, there is a
descent to a deep but smooth and sandy
ford. Upon the summit of the rock there
is, or there was&mdash;my blessing upon it!&mdash;a
thick and beautiful bird-cherry, which
hung over the craig, and whose pendant
branches, taking root on the edge of the
steep, shot up again like the banana, and
formed a natural arbour and close trellis
along the margin of the precipice. Behind
its little gallery, there is a mighty
holly, under which the snow rarely lays
in winter, or the rain drops in summer.
Beneath the shelter of this tree, and
within the bank at its foot, I dug a little
cell large enough to hold two beds, a
bench, a hearth, a table, and a 'kistie.'
The sides were lined with deals well
caulked with moss, and the roof was constructed
in the same manner, but covered
with a tarpauling, which, lying in the slope
of the surrounding bank, carried off any
water which might descend from thaw
or rain, and, when the autumn trees shook
off their leaves, could not be distinguished
from the adjoining bank. Its door was
on the brink of the craig, veiled by the
thick bird-cherries on the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
precipice; and the entrance to the little
path, which ascended from either side
upon the brow of the rock, was concealed
by a screen of birch and hazel, beneath
which the banks were covered with primroses,
wood-anemones, and forget-me-not.
Bowers of honeysuckle and wild-roses
twined among the lower trees; and even
in the tall pines above, the rose sometimes
climbed to the very top, where all its
blossoms, clustering to the sun, hung in
white tassels out of the dark-blue foliage.
There the thrush and the blackbird sang
at morning and evening, and the owl
cried at night, and the buck belled upon
the Torr.&mdash;Blessed, wild, free, joyous
dwelling, which we shall never see
again!"</p></blockquote>

<p>A lovely place indeed must that
have been in the pleasant days of
summer! We do not wonder at the
fondness with which the Stuarts speak
of that lodge in the wilderness, reared
as it was in the midst of the most
beautiful and romantic scenery which
exists within the compass of the seas
of Britain, or, for aught we know,
elsewhere. Years have rolled by since
we last set foot upon the banks of
Findhorn; but never shall we forget
the glories of that deep ravine, or the
noble woods of Altyre, still possessed
by the descendants of the princely
Comyns. Did we not expect to be
summoned out within half an hour to
contribute to the safety of the realm
by breaking the head of a Chartist,
we should ourselves launch out into
description, and try conclusions with
Horatio M'Culloch. But, after all,
it would be a work of supererogation.
Mr St John has already illustrated
most charmingly that abode of the
faithful; and he will not be displeased
to see that, even in painting, he has
met with formidable rivals. Rarely,
indeed, have we met with any thing
so perfect as the following sketch:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Near Slui on the Findhorn there is a
range of precipices and wooded steeps
crowned with pine, and washed by a clear
and rippling stream of the river, through
which there is an excellent ford, very well
known to the roe, for escaping to the
woods of Slui when pressed by the hounds.
This reach is called the Ledanreich, from
a remarkable craig, a sheer naked even
wall of sandstone, lying in horizontal
strata eighty or ninety feet high: At the
eastern extremity of this rock there is a
great division, partly separated from the
main curtain by a deep woody slope, which
dips into the precipice with little more
inclination from the perpendicular than to
admit of careful footing. In the face of
the divided craig, the decomposition of
the softer stone between the courses of
the strata has wasted it away into narrow
galleries, which, passing behind the
tall pillars of the pines growing from the
rifts and ledges, extend along the face of
the precipice, veiled by a deep tapestry of
ivy, which spreads over the mighty wall
of rock, and hangs from shelf to shelf over
the covered ways. Beyond the craigs,
the bank of the forest, an abrupt steep,
covered with oak and copsewood, slopes
down to the river, its brow darkened with
a deep-blue cloud of pines, and its descent
carpeted with moss, primroses, and pyrolas,
here and there hollowed into quaint
'cuachs,' filled with hazels, thorns, and
giant pines. Along this woody scarp, and
through its thick copse, the roe had made
narrow galleries, which communicated
with the ivy corridors on the face of the
craig, to which there were corresponding
ways upon the opposite side. In that
fortress of the rock, for shelter from the
sun and flies, and seclusion from the stir
of the world during the day in the heat
of summer, the red-deer and roe made their
secret haunt, concealed behind the deep
dim veil of leaves, unseen and unsuspected
in the cool hollows of the cliff. The prying
eye might search the craig from below,
and the beaters or the woodmen might
whistle, and whoop, and shout above, but
nothing appeared or moved except the
gray falcon, which rose channering out of
the rifts. Above the craig the wooded
bank was so abrupt, that to the front view
there was no indication of a slope, and
any who passed quickly over the brow
was immediately out of sight. At each
descent beyond the extremities of the
whole range of rocks there was a common
roe's run and pass, which was supposed
to be 'deadly sure' if the deer took the
path, since the precipice below was believed
to be an infallible barrier against
any intermediate escape. Often, however,
when pressed upon the terrace above, the
deer neither went through the passes nor
turned against the beaters, but vanished
as if by magic&mdash;nobody could tell where;
and it was the common opinion of the
drivers and fishermen, that, when forced
near the river, they threw themselves over
the craigs 'for spite,'&mdash;a belief often
confirmed by old Davie Simpson, who
declared that he had often found their
bodies beneath the rocks, and in the
Cluach, the Clerk's Pool, and the 'Furling
Hole.' He did not, however, relate
what <em>wounds</em> they had, and the truth was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that those which disappeared at the brow
of the Ledanreich dashed down the sudden
dip of the bank between the precipices,
and, turning through the ivy corridors,
went out through the copse galleries upon
the other side, and either descended to
the water or skirted below the pass, and
went back into the forest. Those which
were found dead were such as had been
mortally wounded at some in-wood pass,
and, unable to take, or cross the water,
had died on the beach, or been carried
down by the river. In the same mysterious
passages which gave concealment
and escape to the stags and bucks, the
does were used to lay with their kids,
and from thence at morning and evening
they brought them out to pluck the tender
grass upon the green banks beyond. Often
from the brow above, or from behind the
ivy screen, we have watched their 'red
garment' stealing through the boughs,
followed by their little pair drawing their
slender legs daintily through the wet dew,
and turning their large velvet ears to
catch every passing sound upon the breeze
as it brought the hum of the water, or
the crow of the distant cock&mdash;now
trotting before, now lingering behind
their dam, now nestling together, now
starting off as the gale suddenly rustled
the leaves behind them&mdash;then listening
and re-uniting in a timorous plump, pricking
their ears, and bobbing their little
black noses in the wind,&mdash;then, as the
doe dropped on her knees in the moss,
and laid her side on the warm spot where
the morning sun glanced in through the
branches, they gambolled about her, leaping
over her back, and running round in
little circles, uttering that soft, wild, plaintive
cry like the treble note of an accordion,
till, weary of their sport, they lay
down at her side, and slept while she
watched as only a mother can. No marvel
it was that they loved that safe and
fair retreat, with all its songs and flowers,
its plenty and repose. All around was
sweet, and beautiful, and abundant, such
as the poetical imagination of the painter
can rarely compose, and <em>never</em>, unless like
Salvator he has lived in the wilderness
with its free denizens. Upon the summit
above the craig there was a broad and
verdant terrace surrounded by ivied pines
and feathering birches, and upon a little
green glade in the midst grow two of the
most beautiful objects ever produced by
art or nature. These were a pair of twin
thorns exactly similar in size, age, and
form, and standing about three yards
from each other: their stems as straight
as shafts, and their round and even heads
like vast bushes of wild thyme, but each
so overgrown with ivy and woodbine, that
their slender trunks appeared like fretted
columns, over which the thorny foliage
served as a trellis to suspend the heavy
plumes of the ivy and the golden tassels
of the woodbine. Many a 'ladye's bower'
we have seen, and many a rich and costly
plant reared by the care of man, but none
so beautiful as those lonely sisters of the
forest, planted by His hand in His great
garden, where none beheld but those for
whom He made it lovely&mdash;the ravens of
the rock, the deer who couched under its
shade by night, and the birds who sang
their matins and their even-song out of its
sweet boughs."</p></blockquote>

<p>If we go on quoting at this rate, we
shall never reach the hill, and as yet
we have not started from the hut.
To say the truth, we are in no hurry,
and neither, we suspect, upon many
occasions were the Stuarts, indomitable
huntsmen as they are. What
though at night the river swept with
the sound of thunder below, making
the solid rock vibrate to its deep
foundation,&mdash;what though the wind
swept mightily down the ravine,
swaying the trees like saplings, and
threatening to tear them away,&mdash;what
though the windows of heaven were
open, and the deluge came down, and
the bark of the hill-fox sounded
sharp above the roaring of the water
and the wood,&mdash;yet within that little
bothy that rests upon the face of the
craig, the wearied huntsmen slept
peacefully; and in the morning, says
one of them,&mdash;"I was awakened as
usual by the whistle of the robin in
the bird-cherry, and the sharp note of
the blue bonnet sharpening his little
saw on the top of the holly. I went
out to the narrow terre-plain over the
craig. The wind was gone, and the
sun smiling on the still leaves and
dewy grass&mdash;the flood torrent of the
river dancing and laughing in its light,
and the calm bright air breathing
with the sweet perfume of the damp
plants, and all the freshness and
fragrance of the forest wilderness."
We back it against the forest of
Ardennes!</p>

<p>Every true hunter is humane.
What! you say&mdash;do you call it humane
to persecute the unfortunate stag, the
monarch of the wilds, to the death?&mdash;to
drive rifle-bullets into the target
of the harmless roe? to murder otters
by the dozen, and to slaughter seals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
by the score? Indubitably we do.
Let us reason a little upon this. Yesterday,
you recollect that you dined
upon very juvenile veal, smothered in
a mess of dingy vegetable matter
which we apprehend to have been
sorrel, after the beastly fashion of the
Gauls. Posterior to that, you devoured
the larger moiety of a duckling.
This morning we saw you, with our
own eyes, regaling yourself at the
club, between the intervals of muffin,
with what assuredly were cutlets of
lamb. After all this, can you have
the face to stand up and defend your
own humanity? For how many days
had the sun dawned upon that luckless
calf, the mangled fragments of
which upon your platter rather resembled
the rags of a kid-glove,
than food meet for the stomach
of a Christian? How long had
the feeble quackle of Draco been
heard round the row of peas
near which he unsuspiciously perambulated,
little dreaming how much
the pods thereof were mixed up
with his future destiny? How many
races were run upon the meadow by
that perished daughter of the sheep?
Three infantine lives cut off simply
for your sole gormandising! This is
but a slight case. Set you down to a
rook-pie, and you will engulf a dozen
unfortunates before you bury your
visage in the pewter. Pay for you at
Blackwall, and the whitebait will disappear
by the thousand. It is in vain
that you attempt to shift the atrocity
of your inordinate appetite from your
own shoulders to those of the grazier,
the butcher, the poulterer, or the
fisherman. Cobden, or Joe Hume,
or any other of the political economists
belonging to the tribe who would
starve the workman in order that they
may guzzle themselves, will tell you
that invariably the demand regulates
the supply. You, therefore, are the responsible
party: the young have fallen
into your Scylla&mdash;the immature of
days have been swept into the vortex
of your Charybdis! Moreover, if you
were a sportsman&mdash;which you are not&mdash;our
minds would be grievously
troubled for the future safety of the
singing-birds. Welford, the friend of
Bright, as we all remember, proposed
a grand crusade throughout Britain
against the feathered tribe; and you
are not at all unlikely to join in a
general St Bartholomew of the sparrows.
Do you venture to retort upon
us? Do you think we take life unnecessarily,
or that we are base enough
to use our weapons until the quarry
has reached its prime? No calf or
fawn ever fell by the hand of the
genuine hunter&mdash;no cheeper or pout
ever sullied the interior of the sportsman's
bag. Not until the better part
of his life has been run,&mdash;till his
muscles are hard as iron, his slot deep,
and his branches towering on the
beam,&mdash;not until he has lived and
loved, do we strike down, as if with
lightning and painless death, the great
hart in the middle of the wilderness.
But to all innocent things&mdash;to the
harmless indwellers of the forest and
moor, the true hunter is a guardian
and a friend. The strong man is ever
brave, and none but the strong can
pass to where the herds of the mountain
dwell.</p>

<p>One more scene at the Hut, and we
shall illustrate this subject further.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But though our bothie was far from
resembling the Peri Paribanon's cell, or
the rock-palace where the old kaiser
keeps his court in the bowels of the Unterberg&mdash;we
loved it, not only for its
bucks and stags, and all its greenwood
cheer, but for the love of nature by which
it was surrounded. Beyond its 'vert
and venison,' there was a world of life
and interest for those who had the eye
to mark and the heart to read its book.
On every side we had companions; from
the passenger which came from Norway,
to the little native guest&mdash;the robin which
roosted in the holly-bush above us. '<em>The</em>
robin?'&mdash;you smile and say. Yes, there
was but one. He lived in the bush, as we
lived in the bothie, and we were his neighbours
too long not to be very well acquainted.
His species, as well as all the
small tribes, conformable to the minuteness
of their range and habits, are very
local, and may be found all the year in,
or near, the same place; and those who
feed them will rarely wait many minutes
for their appearance. There were many
robins which lived about the bothie, and
all were continually in its vicinity, and
very tame; but none so gentle and grateful
as our little neighbour in the holly.
They would, however, enter the hut, sit
on the bed or the table, and hop about
the floor, and, when I went out, follow
me to the brae. They liked very much
to see me turn up the soil, which always
provided them with a little feast; accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
they were never absent at the
planting of a shrub or a flower; and when
I brought home, in my shooting-bag, a
tuft of primroses, pyrolas, or lilies of the
valley, they were always in attendance to
see them put into the bank. For watching
my occupation, they preferred something
more elevated than the ground, but
not so high as the branches of the trees,
which were too far from the earth to give
them a clear sight of what I turned up;
for their accommodation, therefore, I
made little crosses and crotchets, and,
when I was planting, set them up beside
me, moving them as I proceeded from
place to place. Each was immediately
occupied by an attentive observer; and,
whenever an insect or a worm was discovered,
one of the nearest darted down
and caught it, even from between my
fingers, and disappeared for a few moments
under the rock or behind the great
holly, to enjoy his success undisturbed.
At his disappearance his place was immediately
occupied by another, but at
the return of the first it was amiably resigned
by his successor. The blue-bonnets
were almost as numerous as the
robins, but they never arrived at the same
intimacy and confidence. They never
entered the bothie in my presence, and
even when I fed them they would not
approach as long as I remained outside
the door; but as soon as I went in they
descended four or five together, chattering
and fluttering about the entrance,
peeping in at the little window, and
stretching their necks as far as they could,
to see where I was, and if all was right.
Then they would begin their breakfast on
what I had left for them, talking a great
deal about it, but occasionally ogling the
door, in a manner from which I concluded
that there was but small esteem or gratitude
in their conversation.&mdash;&mdash;Far different
was the friendship of our little neighbour
in the holly. In the morning he
used to come down and perch on the arm
of the bird-cherry, which stretched over
the precipice before the door, waiting for
its opening and the preparation of the
breakfast, which he always shared; and
when we were seated he would venture
over the sill, and gather the crumbs about
the table at our feet. Often when the
first blood-red streaks of the autumn morning
shone like lurid fire through the little
window, we were awakened by his sad
and solitary whistle, as he sat on his
usual branch, his jet-black eye cast towards
the door, impatient for our appearance.
Many of his little cousins there
were in the wood, with whom we were
also well acquainted, and between us
happened many an incident, which increased
our interest and familiarity.</p>

<p>"I remember a day, one of those deep
still blue days so solemn in the forest;
the ground was covered with a foot of
snow, and all the trees were hanging like
gigantic ostrich feathers; but all the
world was blue,&mdash;the sky was a sleeping
mass of those heavy indigo clouds which
forebode a 'feeding storm,'&mdash;not a tempest,
but a fall of snow; for, in Scotland,
snow is called '<em>storm</em>,' however light and
still it falls: thus, in tracking the deer,
we say he 'has brushed the <em>storm</em> from
the heather;' and a '<em>feeding storm</em>' is
when the clouds are continually feeding
the earth with its velvet pall.&mdash;The reflection
of those deep-blue clouds cast a
delicate tint of the same colour over the
whitened world. I was standing with
my back against a huge pine&mdash;one of the
old remnant of the great forest of Moray,
which had, no doubt, heard the bell toll
for the first Stuart earl.&mdash;I counted the
rings in a smaller tree which once stood
in the same hollow;&mdash;I shunned its wreck
as I would have avoided a corpse which
I could not bury, and always, when I
passed near it, averted my face; but one
day running to cut off a buck, and just
heading him, I dropped on my knee to
receive him as he came out from a mass
of junipers, and when reloading, I found
that I had knelt by the stump of my old
friend.&mdash;I counted two hundred and
sixty-four rings in his wood!&mdash;how many
earls had he seen?&mdash;Well, I was leaning
against his elder brother, as I suppose
by the size. I had been there for a long
time, waiting to hear the dogs bring back
a buck from&mdash;I don't know now from
where.&mdash;&mdash;As I had been through all the
swamps, and stripes, and wet hollows on
that side of the forest, and waded through
two and three feet of snow-wreaths, my
kilt and hose, and, as it seemed, my flesh was
saturated to the bones with 'snaw-bree,'
and I began to beat, first one foot, and then
the other, to quicken the blood, which
was warm enough in my trunk.&mdash;I had
scarce commenced this exercise, when I
heard a little 'tic!' close to my ear,
and the soft low voice of a bird&mdash;a sound,
neither a whistle nor a chirp, but which
I knew very well before I turned and
saw the robin, who sat on a dry branch
within a yard of my cheek. I guessed
what had brought him: he was very
cold, his ruffled back humped as round as
a ball, and his tail drooping almost perpendicular
with his legs, as if it was a
little brown peg to lean on, like that on
which the travelling Tyrolean merchant
rests his pack. He looked at me with
his large black eye, then, with a flirt of
his tail and a bow with his head, indicated
that, if I had no objection, he
should like to descend to the place which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
I occupied; the object of which he expressed,
by turning his head sidelong,
and directing one eye into the black
earth which my foot had beaten bare in
the snow. I immediately drew back a
couple of feet, and he instantly dropped
into the spot of mould, peeped and picked
under every leaf and clod of earth, and,
when there was nothing more, hopped up
on the guard of my rifle, on which I was
leaning, and, turning his head, looked at
me with his upper eye.&mdash;I again stepped
forward, and recommenced my foot-exercise,
during which he returned to his
branch, examining my progress with some
impatience. As soon as my foot was
removed, he again dropped into the hollow,
and busily collected all the little
grubs and chrysales which, though too
small for me to see as I stood, I knew
abounded beneath the sere leaves and
thatch of moss and sticks. In this manner
I repeated his supply several times,
on one of which, when I was too long, or
he too impatient, he dropped from his
perch, and hovered over the space in
which my foot was at work, and, as I
continued, lighted on the point of the
other shoe, and remained there, peeping
into the hollow, until I withdrew my foot,
and then descended to finish his repast.
When he was satisfied, he ruffed his
feathers, looked up sidelong to me, and,
after a shake of satisfaction, resumed his
perch close to my head, and, after pruning
and oiling his feathers, mounted
another branch higher, and opened his
little throat with that most sad, sweet,
and intermitting warble which gives such
a melancholy charm to a still winter's
day."</p></blockquote>

<p>Take a picture of the roe, and you
will hardly doubt the humanity of our
sportsmen. But why talk of it thus?
No one, we hope, save a member of
the Manchester manufacturing school
could feel otherwise&mdash;certainly not a
genuine hills-man; and we quote the
passage simply for its extreme beauty
and perfect fidelity to nature. No
creature is more beautiful than the
kid of the roe-deer, especially when
seen in their rest, or moving through
the ferns, on a summer evening, beside
their gentle mother the doe.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the bedding season the does retire
into the most secret thickets, or other
lonely places, to produce their young, and
cover them so carefully that they are very
rarely found; we have, however, deceived
their vigilance. There was a solitary doe
which lived in the hollow below the
Bràigh-cloiche-léithe in Tarnaway. I suppose
that we had killed her 'marrow;'
but I was careful not to disturb her
haunt, for she was very fat and round,
stepped with much caution, and never
went far to feed. Accordingly, when at
evening and morning she came out to pick
the sweet herbs at the foot of the brae, or
by the little green well in its face, I trode
softly out of her sight, and if I passed at
noon, made a circuit from the black willows,
or thick junipers, where she reposed
during the heat. At last, one fine sunny
morning I saw her come tripping out
from her bower of young birches as light
as a fairy, and very gay and 'canty'&mdash;but
so thin, nobody but an old acquaintance
could have known her. For various
mornings afterwards I saw her on the
bank, but she was always restless and
anxious&mdash;listening and searching the
wind&mdash;trotting up and down&mdash;picking a
leaf here and a leaf there, and after her
short and unsettled meal, she would take
a frisk round leap into the air&mdash;dart down
into her secret bower, and appear no more
until the twilight. In a few days, however,
her excursions became a little more
extended, generally to the terrace above
the bank, but never out of sight of the
thicket below. At length she ventured
to a greater distance, and one day I stole
down the brae among the birches. In
the middle of the thicket there was a
group of young trees growing out of a
carpet of deep moss, which yielded like a
down pillow. The prints of the doe's
slender-forked feet were thickly tracked
about the hollow, and in the centre there
was a bed of the velvet 'fog,' which
seemed a little higher than the rest, but
so natural, that it would not have been
noticed by any unaccustomed eye. I
carefully lifted the green cushion, and
under its veil, rolled close together, the
head of each resting on the flank of the
other, nestled two beautiful little kids, their
large velvet ears laid smooth on their
dappled necks, their spotted sides sleek
and shining as satin, and their little delicate
legs as slender as hazel wands, shod
with tiny glossy shoes as smooth and
black as ebony, while their large dark
eyes looked at me out of the corners with
a full, mild, quiet gaze, which had not
yet learned to fear the hand of man: still
they had a nameless doubt which followed
every motion of mine&mdash;their little limbs
shrunk from my touch, and their velvet
fur rose and fell quickly; but as I was
about to replace the moss, one turned its
head, lifted its sleek ears towards me,
and licked my hand as I laid their soft
mantle over them. I often saw them
afterwards when they grew strong, and
came abroad upon the brae, and frequently
I called off old Dreadnought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
when he crossed their warm track. Upon
these occasions he would stand and look
at me with wonder&mdash;turn his head from
side to side&mdash;snuff the ground again, to
see if it was possible that he could be
mistaken&mdash;and when he found that there
was no disputing the scent, cock one ear
at me with a keener inquiry, and seeing
that I was in earnest, trot heavily onward
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"The affection of the roe for their young
is very strong; and timid and feeble as
they are by nature, inspired by the danger
of their offspring, they become brave and
daring, and, in their defence, will attack
not only animals but men. We were one
day passing along the west walk of
Eilean-Agais, and, beyond a turn in the
path, heard the sound of feet running towards
us, and immediately out shot a cat
round the corner, and, close at her heels,
a doe pursuing her with great eagerness.
Knowing that her pursuer could not overtake
her, and having no instinctive dread
of her kind, the cat did not give herself
the trouble to run faster than just sufficient
to keep beyond her reach, while the
doe pursued her with an angry scrambling
pace, and, whenever she was near overtaking
her, endeavoured to kneel on her
back. This is a mode of attack common
to deer as well as cattle, which, when
they have overthrown their object, not
only gore them with their horns, but
bruise and crush them with their knees.
At our appearance there was a pause;
the cat cantered up the brae to the top of
a little rock, where she lay down in the
sun to see what would happen between
us and her pursuer. The doe, after a few
bounds, turned round and looked indignantly
at us, and stamped and belled in
great displeasure; this she continued for
some moments, glancing occasionally at
the cat with a strong desire to resume
her chase; but being restrained by a sense
of prudence, she slowly ascended the hill,
stopping at intervals to stamp and bell at
us, who knew very well that she had two
kids in the junipers upon the craig."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now let us up to the hill, where the
mighty herds are feeding. Scotland
will, in all probability, never see a
tainchel more; indeed, save at a royal
hunting, it were scarcely desirable
now. The feudal system has melted
away, the clans are broken and scattered,
and we care not again to see a
pageant which is indissolubly connected
in our memories with national
gallantry and misfortune. But the
deer are still on the mountain and in
the wood, and we shall seek them in
their former haunt. Wood-stalking,
though the Stuarts speak of it with
considerable enthusiasm, was never
much to our taste. It is true that the
largest stags are generally to be met
with in the wood, and we have followed
the sport ere now in the Spessart,
among the pines of Darmstadt,
and the thickets of Strath Garve; but
it must always partake more or less
of the character of driving, and we
never have felt, while engaged in it,
that enthusiasm and keenness which
sends the blood to the heart of the
hunter when he first discovers a herd
in the gorge of some solitary glen.
Then he feels that he must put forth
the whole resources of his art&mdash;that
he must baffle the acutest of all instincts
by the aid of human cunning&mdash;that
he has a thousand difficulties
to overcome before he can arrive
within reach of his quarry, and that a
single false step or miscalculation is
sufficient to destroy the labour, the
patience, and the vigilance of a day.</p>

<p>Great, fat fallow-deer, waxing into
obesity in a park, do not seem to mind
the approach of a human being, even
were he an alderman redolent of black-currant
jelly. But the red-deer, as
many incipient stalkers know to their
cost, has a very different amount of
perception. Unless you take the wind
of him, he is off like a shot, though
your distance may be upwards of a
mile. In the words of the old stalker,
"Above all things, let not the devil
tempt you to trifle with a deer's
nose: you may cross his sight, walk
up to him in a gray coat, or, if
standing against a tree or rock near
your own colour, wait till he walks
up to you; but you cannot cross
his nose, even at an incredible distance,
but he will feel the tainted
air. Colours or forms may be deceptive
or alike; there are gray, brown,
and green rocks and stocks as well
as men, and all these may be equivocal;
but there is <em>but one scent of man</em>,
and that he never doubts or mistakes;
that is filled with danger and terror,
and one whiff of its poison at a mile
off, and, whether feeding or lying, his
head is instantly up, his nose to the
wind, and, in the next moment, his
broad antlers turn, and he is away to
the hill or the wood; and if there are
no green peas, corn, or potatoes in the
neighbourhood, he may not be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
on the same side of the forest for a
month." A word to the wise, from
the lips of a Celtic Solon!</p>

<p>So much for your chance, if, in the
plenitude of your full flavour, you take
the hill, regardless of the currents of
the air, which, moreover, are perpetually
shifting. But there are other
difficulties. Though not impossible,
it is very ticklish work to get within
shot of a deer by any other means
save diligent creeping, and sometimes,
when the ground is unusually flat and
open, that method of approach is impracticable.
Then there are divers enemies&mdash;that
is, of yours, for in reality
they are scouts to the deer&mdash;whom
you must try particularly to avoid. This
is not easy. Sometimes when you
are sinuating like a serpent towards
the especial stag of your heart, a
blundering covey of grouse will start
from the heather, and give an effectual
alarm; sometimes the shrill whistle
of the plover will change your anticipated
triumph into mourning; and
sometimes a charge of that disagreeable
cavalry the mountain sheep, little
less sagacious and wary than the deer
themselves, will put the whole of the
glen into disorder. But the worst
enemies you have to guard against are
the hinds, who are usually so disposed
as to be out upon the feeding-grounds,
and thus to mask the stag. In such
a position, it becomes a point of honour
to circumvent the lady, which is any
thing but an easy task. The Stuarts
give us an admirable recollection of
such a scene in the forest of Glen-Fidich,
which is so exciting that,
though rather long, we make no apology
for transferring it to the columns
of Maga.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After about an hour's stalking, we
came upon the shoulder of a long slope,
which looks into the gorges of two or
three short glens, opening to a narrow
plain, on which we saw a noble sight&mdash;a
herd of four or five hundred deer,
among which were many very fine stags.
After having feasted my eyes with this
splendid sight&mdash;the illustrious cavalry of
the hill, the crowned and regal array of
the wilderness&mdash;I began to calculate how
to make the approach, how to slip between
the chain of vidette hinds, and
numerous picquets of small stags, which
commanded almost every knoll and hollow.
In the centre of the main body,
with a large plump of hinds&mdash;which he
herded within a wide vacant circle&mdash;there
was a mighty black hart, with a
head like a blasted pine, and a cluster of
points in each crown. Though each stag
of the surrounding circle had not less
than ten points, there were none which
approached his size, and they all kept at
a respectful distance, while he marched
round and round the central group of
hinds. 'He will have them all in the
ring before long,' said MacLellan; 'yon's
one of the old heroes of the Monadh-liath;
he has not been four-and-twenty hours in
the forest.' I looked with an eager and
longing eye at his gigantic stature, but
there was no apparent possibility of approaching
even the outward circle of
stags. The herd was scattered over all
the ground between the hills, and every
little knoll and eminence had its restless
picquets, and plumps of discomfited stags,
which had been beaten by the great hart,
and were chafing about, driving off and
broding the buttocks of all the inferior
stags which came in their way, then returning
and staring with jealous disgust
at the mighty stranger, who gave them
no notice, except when one or two more
audacious, or less severely beaten, made
a few steps before his companions; upon
which he immediately charged, drove
them before him, and scattered the nearest
in every direction. Upon these occasions,
some hind of greater levity than
the rest took the opportunity of extending
her pasture, or paying her compliments
to her companions, for which she immediately
received a good prod in the
haunch, and was turned back again into
the centre.</p>

<p>"'There is no doing any thing there,'
said I.</p>

<p>"''Deed no', replied MacLellan, shutting
up his glass, 'we be to go down to
the foot of the burn.'</p>

<p>"This was a stream which runs through
the middle of the narrow plain, and
empties itself into the Fidich, about four
miles below, at the east end of the forest.
Before resolving upon this, however, we
made an attempt to cross the little glen
to the north-west; but, after passing
round one hill, and nearly to the top of
another, we fell in with a small herd of
insignificant stags, but none among them
being worth the disturbance of the great
herd; and being unable to pass them unobserved,
we were obliged to adopt the
last alternative, and descend to the Fidich.
In about an hour and a half we
performed this retrogration, and, having
crossed at the forester's house, ascended
the burn till we again approached the
deer, and stealing from knoll to knoll,
again came in sight of the herd. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
outskirts of its wide circle had been much
broken and deranged by the jousts and
expulsions during our absence; and we
saw that it was impossible to get near the
better stags without taking the channel
of the stream. We immediately descended
into the water, and crept up the
middle, sometimes compelled to crouch
so low, that the pools reached our hips,
and, as the stones were round and slippery,
it was very uneasy to proceed without
floundering and splashing. At length,
however, we were within the circle of the
deer: there was not a breath of wind, and
the least sound was audible in the profound
stillness. We slipped through the
water like eels, till we came to a little
rock, which, crossing the burn, made a
shelving fall, which there was no means
of passing, but by drawing ourselves up
the shoot of the stream. With some
difficulty I pushed my rifle before me
along the edge of the bank, and then,
while the water ran down our breasts, we
glided up through the gush of the stream,
and reached the ledge above. The return
of the water, which I had obstructed,
made, however, a rush and plash different
from its accustomed monotonous hum, and
I had scarce time to lay flat in the burn,
when a <em>hind</em> sprung up within a few
yards, and trotted briskly away, then
another, and another. I thought that all
was over, and that, in the next moment,
we should hear all the clattering hoofs
going over the turf like a squadron of
cavalry. All remained still, however,
and, in a few seconds, I saw the first hind
wheel about, and look back steadily towards
the fall. I was rejoiced to observe
that she had not seen us, and had only
been disturbed by the unusual sound of
the water. She continued, however,
anxious and suspicious&mdash;watched and
listened&mdash;picked off the tops of the heather&mdash;then
walked on, with her ears laid
back, and her neck and step stilting away
as stiff as if she had been hung up in the
larder for a week. This, however, was
not the worst; all the surrounding <em>hinds</em>
which noticed her gait gathered here and
there, and stood on the tops of the little
knolls, like statues, as straight as pucks,
with nothing visible but their narrow
necks and two peg-legs, and their broad
ears perked immovably towards us, like
long-eared bats. MacLellan gave me a
rueful look. 'Cha n'eil comas air.'
'Never mind,' said I, 'we shall see who
will be tired first.' The forester gave a
glance of satisfaction, slid up his glass on
the dry bank, and we lay as still as the
stones around us, till the little trouts,
which had been disturbed by our convulsion,
became so accustomed to our shapes,
that they again emerged from under the
flat pebbles, and returned to their station
in the middle of the stream, skulling
their little tails between my legs with no
more concern than if I had been a forked
tree. At length the immobility of the
hinds began to give way: first one ear
turned back, then another, then they became
sensible of the flies, and began to
flirt and jerk as usual, and, finally, one
applied her slender toe to her ear, and
another rubbed her velvet nose upon her
knee;&mdash;it was more than half an hour,
however, before, one by one, they began
to steal away, perking and snuffing, and
turning to gaze at the least air that
whiffed about them. At length they all
disappeared, except one gray, lean, haggard
old grandmother of hinds, who had
no teeth, and limped with one leg, probably
from a wound which she received fifty
or perhaps a hundred years before I was
born. Her vigilance, however, was only
sharpened by age; time, and the experience
of many generations, had made her
acquainted with all the wiles and crafts
of the hill,&mdash;her eyes and ears were as
active as a kid's, and I have no doubt
she could smell like Tobit's devil.&mdash;MacLellan
looked at her through his glass,
and spit into the burn, and grinned
against the sun&mdash;as if he was lying in
the bilboes instead of cold water.&mdash;The
old sorceress continued to watch us without
relaxation, and at last lay down on
the brow of the knoll, and employed her
rumination in obstinate contemplation of
the bank under which we were ambushed.
There was now no alternative but to
recommence our progress up the burn;
and as I was determined to circumvent
the hind, I prepared for every inconvenience
which could be inflicted by the
opposite vexations of a sharp, rough,
slippery, and gravelly stream. Fortunately,
at the place where we then were,
it was so narrow, that we could hold by
the heather on both sides, and thus drag
ourselves forward through the water, between
each of which advances I pushed
my rifle on before me. In this manner we
reached the turn of the brook, where I
concluded that we should be round the
shoulder of the knoll, and out of sight of
the hind, who lay upon its east brow.
This was effected so successfully, that,
when we looked behind, we only saw her
back, and her head and ears still pointing
at the spot which we had left. One hundred
yards more would bring us within sight of
the great hart; the general position of the
herd had not changed, and I hoped to find
him near the central knoll of the flat, at
the base of which the burn circled. We
were almost surrounded by deer; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
greater number were small vigilant hinds,
the abomination and curse of a stalker.
At length, however, we reached the
knoll, and rested, to take breath, at its
foot; I examined my rifle, to see that
the lock was clean and dry. We took a
view of all around us, and, drawing ourselves
cautiously out of the burn, slid up
through the heather on the south side of
the eminence.&mdash;Scarce, however, had our
legs cleared the stream, when we discovered
a pair of ears not above fifteen
yards from the other side.&mdash;'<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Mo mhallachd
ort!</i>' [My curse upon you]&mdash;whispered
MacLellan. She had not discovered
us, however, and we glided
round the base of the knoll&mdash;but on the
other side lay three hinds and a calf,
and I could see no trace of the great
hart.&mdash;On the edge of the burn, however,
further up, there were five very good
stags, and a herd of about thirty deer,
on the slope of the north brae. All round
us the ground was covered with hinds;
for the prevalence of the westerly wind,
during the last few days, had drawn the
deer to that end of the forest. Upon the
spot where I lay, though I could only see
a portion of the field, I counted four hundred
and seventy; and it was evident
that no movement could be made upon
that side. We tried again the opposite
slope of the knoll;&mdash;the hind which we
had first seen was still in the same place,
but she had laid down her head, and
showed only the gray line of her back
over the heather. We drew ourselves
cautiously up the slope and looked over
the summit. On the other side there
was a small flat moss, about seventy yards
in breadth; then another hillock; and to
the left two more, with little levels, and
wet grassy hollows between them. Upon
the side of the first knoll there were two
young stags and some hinds; but the points
of some good horns showed above the crest.&mdash;The
intervening ground was spotted
with straggling hinds, and we might lay
where we were till to-morrow morning,
without a chance of getting near any of
the good deer. While we deliberated,
MacLellan thought that, by crawling with
extreme caution up a wet hollow to the
left, we might have a chance to approach
the stags whose horns we had seen behind
the other knoll, and, as nothing better
could be done, we decided upon this
attempt. The sun was going down from
the old towers of Auchandùn, and we had
no more time than would give light for
this venture.&mdash;We slid away towards the
hollow, and, drawing ourselves, inch by
inch, though the heather and tall thin
grass, had reached the middle of the level
between the hillocks, when we heard a
stamp and a short grunt close beside us&mdash;I
had scarce time to turn my head, and
catch a glimpse of a base little gray hind
who, in crossing the hollow, had stumbled
upon us.&mdash;It was but a moment: a rapid
wheel and rush through the long grass,
and I heard the career of a hundred feet
going through the hollow. I sprung on
my knee, and skaled a dozen small stags
and hinds which came upon us full speed;
for those behind, not knowing from whence
came the alarm, made straight for the hill.
The herd were now gathering in all directions;
charging&mdash;flying&mdash;re-uniting, dispersing,
and reassembling in utter disorder,
like a rout of cavalry.&mdash;I made a run for
the middle knoll,&mdash;two stags, with pretty
good heads, met me right in the face.&mdash;I
did not stop to look at them, but rushed
up the brae.&mdash;What a sight was seen from
its top!&mdash;upwards of six hundred deer
were charging past&mdash;before, behind,
around, in all directions.&mdash;The stately
figure which I sought&mdash;the mighty black
hart, was slowly ascending an eminence
about three hundred yards off, from
whence he reconnoitred the ground below;
while the disarray of stags and hinds
gathered round him, like rallying masses
of hussars in the rear of a supporting
column. I was so intent upon the king
of the forest, that I saw nothing else.&mdash;No
other heads, forms, numbers, took any
place in my senses; all my faculties were
on the summit of that height.&mdash;At this
moment I felt my kilt drawn gently; I
took no notice&mdash;but a more decided pull
made me look round:&mdash;MacLellan motioned
up the slope, and I saw the points
of a good head passing behind a little
ridge, about eighty yards away. I looked
back at the hart&mdash;he was just moving to
the hill. What would I have given to
have diminished a hundred and fifty yards
of the distance which divided us! He
passed slowly down the back of the eminence
and disappeared, and the gathering
herd streamed after him. '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O Chìal! A
Chìal!</i>' exclaimed the forester&mdash;'<i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">bithidh
è air fàlbh!</i>' The stag whose horns I
had seen had come out from behind the
ridge, and stood with his broad side towards
me, gazing at the herd; but as
they moved away, he now began to follow.
The disappearance of the great hart, and
the disappointment of MacLellan, recalled
me to the last chance. I followed the
retreating stag with my rifle, passed it
before his shoulder, whiz went the two-ounce
ball, and he rolled over headlong
in the heath, on the other side of the
knoll, which the next stretch would have
placed between us. I looked to the hill
above: the whole herd was streaming up
the long green hollow in its west shoulder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
headed 'by the mighty of the desert.'
They rounded and passed the brow, and
sloped upward on the other side, till the
forest of heads appeared bristling along
the sky-line of the summit. In a few
moments afterwards, as the sun was going
down upon Scùr-na-Lapaich, and the far
western hills of Loch Duaich, the terrible
wide-forked tree came out in the clear
eastern sky on the top of the hill, and,
crowding after, at least two hundred heads&mdash;crossing,
and charging, and mingling&mdash;their
polished points flashing in the parting
sunbeams, and from many a horn,
the long steamers of the moss fluttering
and flying like the pennons and bannerolles
of lances. The herd continued to
file along the ridge of the hill, and wheeling
below the crest, countermarched along
the sky-line, till their heads and horns
slowly decreased against the light."</p></blockquote>

<p>With such a book as this before us,
we could go on alternately commenting
and extracting until we had broken
the back of the Number. Even now
we are dying to pilfer the account of
the late Glengarry's course with
"Black Dulochan," and the no less
exciting history of the three day's ruse
with a roebuck. But abstinence is a
virtue which is forced upon us in the
present instance, rather from the lack
of space than from any exercise of
voluntary discretion; and we shall now
leave the deer without further molestation
for a season, hoping soon to encounter
them in person with our rifle
somewhere about the skirts of Cairn-Gorm.</p>

<p>This is, we have no hesitation in
saying, the best work on deer-stalking
which has yet been written; and the
amount of information which it contains
regarding the habits of the stag
and roe, combined with the vivid pictures
of which we have made such ample
use, cannot fail to render it popular.
In an antiquarian point of view, it is
also highly interesting; for it embodies
a large amount of traditionary lore,
sketches of the clans, and fragments
of Highland song, of much superior
merit to those which have hitherto
come into our hands. The disquisitions,
too, upon the disappearance of
some animals once indigenous to
Scotland&mdash;such as the wolf, the elk,
the wild bull, and the beaver&mdash;exhibit
a great amount of research, and supply
a gap which has long been wanted
in the page of natural history.</p>

<p>One word to the authors&mdash;though
we fear our words must travel a long
way before they can reach them in a
foreign land. Why should they not
recast and add to their second volume,
so as to make it a single and unrivalled
work upon the noblest sports of the
Highlands? If it has proved so fascinating,
as in truth we have felt it, in
the more cumbrous shape of notes,
how much better would it be if issued,
not as an appendage to the poems,
but in a distinct and articulate form?
Perpend upon this, John Sobieski and
Charles Edward, at your leisure; and
let us add, that we trust some of your
more gloomy anticipations may fall
short of reality; that the walks of
Eilean-Agais, that little Eden of the
north, may again be gladdened by
your presence; and that the sound of
your hunting-horns may once more be
heard in the woods of Tarnaway, and
on the hills near the sources of the
Findhorn.</p>

<h2>THE NAVIGATION LAWS.</h2>


<p>"When the Act of Navigation,"
says Adam Smith, "was made, though
England and Holland were not actually
at war, the most violent animosity
subsisted between the two nations.
It is not impossible, therefore,
that some of the regulations of this
famous act may have proceeded from
national animosity. They <em>are as wise,
however, as if they had all been dictated
by the most deliberate wisdom</em>. National
animosity, at that particular
time, aimed at the very object which
the most deliberate wisdom would
have recommended,&mdash;the diminution
of the naval power of Holland, the
only naval power which could endanger
the security of England. The
Act of Navigation is not favourable to
foreign commerce, or to the growth of
that opulence which can arise from it.
As defence, however, is of much more
value than opulence, the Act of Navigation
is perhaps the wisest of all the
commercial regulations of England."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Before these pages issue from the
press, this, undoubtedly the wisest of
all the commercial regulations of Great
Britain, and under which the maritime
strength and colonial empire of England
have risen to a pitch of grandeur
unknown in any other age or country,
will be numbered among the things
which have been. The House of
Commons, by a majority, have voted
for the repeal of the Navigation Laws.</p>

<p>Free trade will soon have done its
work, so far, at least, as the House of
Commons is concerned. It is gradually
but unceasingly advancing, and swallowing
up successively all the great
interests of the empire, save that of
the capitalists, as it moves forward.
The agricultural interests will find
themselves deprived, in February next,
of all protection; and the British cultivator
exposed to the competition,
without any shield save a nominal duty
of 1s. a quarter, of states where wheat
can be raised, with a fair profit in
average years, at 18s. a quarter, and
brought to this country for 10s. at the
very utmost of freight. As soon as
we have two fine harvests in succession,
it will be seen to what state this
system will reduce British rural production.
The West India interests
have been next assailed; and our
colonies, upon whom free labour has
been forced, upon a compensation
being given to the proprietors on an
average of a fourth of the value of
their slaves, are speedily to be exposed,
with no protection but a differential
duty of 5s. 6d. a hundredweight, diminishing
1s. 6d. a-year, till, in 1854, it
disappears, to the competition of slave
colonies, where sugar can be raised for
£4 a ton, while in the British colonies
the measures of government have precluded
its being raised for less than
£10 a ton. As a natural consequence,
cultivation is about to cease in those
noble settlements; the forest and the
jungle will speedily supplant the
smiling plantations, and £100,000,000
worth of British property will be lost
beyond redemption.</p>

<p>Domestic manufactures were at
the same time assailed, though
with a more gentle hand than rude
produce. Protective duties on them
were lowered, though not entirely
removed; and the consequence is,
that at this time there are 8000
hands wholly unemployed at Manchester,
and above 10,000 at Glasgow,
and distress to an unparalleled extent
pervades the whole commercial
and manufacturing classes. Nothing
daunted by these calamitous results,
so exactly what the opponents of free
trade predicted would ensue, so diametrically
the reverse of the unbounded
prosperity which they promised
the nation as the consequence
of their changes, the Free-traders, in
pursuance of their usual system of
preferring their own opinions to the
evidence of facts, are preparing to
apply the same system to the commercial
navy of the country, and, by
the repeal of the Navigation Laws,
against the opinion of Adam Smith, to
depress our shipping interest as much
as they encourage that of foreign
states, and endanger our national
existence, by crippling our own means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of defence as much as they augment
the means of attack in the hands of
our enemies. Not content with rendering
us dependent for a large part
of our bread on foreign nations, they
are determined on measures calculated
to deprive us of the means of maintaining
our naval superiority, or upholding
the national independence.
They are set upon saying the nation
a few millions a-year in freight, though
the consequence is, that we shall be
alike unable to withstand a pacific
blockade or hostile aggression.</p>

<p>Many estimable and thoughtful persons
in the country, struck with astonishment
at the adoption and determined
adherence to such a suicidal
policy&mdash;alike by our rulers and a
powerful party in the country&mdash;in the
face of the decisive evidence afforded
by facts, and the universal distress of
the nation, as to its ruinous tendency,
have come to the opinion, that we
have been struck with a judicial blindness,
and that Providence, as a just
punishment for our sins, and for the
furtherance of its mysterious designs
in the general government of mankind,
has rendered our own infatuation the
means of working out our destruction.
They think it affords a marvellous
proof of the weakness of the
human mind, and the impotence of
man against the arm of his Creator,
that this vast empire, which has done
such mighty things in the annals of
history, and which has stood proof
against the hostility of the combined
world, directed by consummate ability,
when its rule was that of justice,
should thus crumble away and perish,
not from external violence or foreign
aggression, but solely from domestic
infatuation, when that rule has
passed away. And observing that this
country has already suffered greater
losses, and been more severely crippled
in its resources by the effects of three
years of free trade and fettered currency
policy, than by the whole efforts
of France during a war of twenty
years&mdash;and still the same course is
blindly persevered in&mdash;they draw the
conclusion that the evil is irremediable
by human means, and that the
nation, if not absolutely shipwrecked,
will approach as near the verge of
ruin as the providence of God will
permit human infatuation to effect.</p>

<p>Without denying that there is much
truth in these observations, and humbly
acknowledging a Divine superintendence
alike in the rise and the decline,
the prosperity and decay, of nations,
it yet appears more reasonable to trace
the extraordinary obstinacy of the
ruling party in the nation to the causes
which, humanly speaking, seem to
have been mainly instrumental in producing
it. The fanaticism of the political
economists, who, like all other
fanatics, are inaccessible to reason or
experience, is, without doubt, a main
cause of the disastrous policy to which
the nation seems now irrevocably
pledged. But a still more powerful
agent in producing the determined
adherence to this system, in the face of
the most conclusive evidence of its
pernicious tendency, is to be found in
the <em>class</em> government which it is now
apparent the Reform Bill has imposed
upon the nation. It is now unhappily
proved that the <em>trading</em> interest, in
whom a decisive majority both in the
constituency and the number of seats
in parliament has been vested by the
Reform Bill, are alive, like all other
classes, mainly to the suggestions of
their own advantage; and that advantage
they think is, to buy cheap and sell
dear. Whatever we were in the days
when Napoleon said it, we are now, if
not a nation of shopkeepers, at least a
nation <em>ruled by shopkeepers</em>. The
colonies are entirely unrepresented.
Schedules A and B, sixteen years ago,
cut off all their representatives. The
landed interest is in a minority, from
two-thirds of the seats in the Commons
being for boroughs; and those
boroughs, owing to the depression of
the producing classes by the currency
laws, and the vast increase of the trading
interests from the same cause, being
for the most part under the direction of
the commercial part of the community.
It is in these circumstances that we
are to look for the real causes of the
adoption of free-trade principles of
late years by our statesmen, and the
determined adherence to it, in spite of
all experience, by a majority of the
House of Commons. Such conduct is
the inevitable result of every <em>uniform</em>
system of representation, because that
lands the government in the class government
of the majority, composed of
a particular interest. The evil was
not felt under the old constitution,
because it was <em>not</em> a class government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
being based on a multifarious, not a
uniform representation. Its <em>defects</em>, as
they are now called, <em>i. e.</em> its nomination
boroughs, combined with the extension
of our colonial and shipping
interests, had let in a most efficient
representation of <em>all</em> the interests in
the empire, as well as that of the inhabitants
of those islands, into the
House of Commons. It is to this
cause that the protection of <em>all</em> interests
by the old House of Commons
is to be ascribed. Doubtless, under
the old system the Corn Laws would
have been upheld; but the West Indies
would have been saved from ruin,
domestic industry rescued from bankruptcy
and the Navigation Laws, the
palladium of our national independence,
preserved from destruction.</p>

<p>That the Navigation Laws have been
a great advantage to our shipowners
and seafaring interests is self-evident.
They afforded superior advantages in
conducting the trade of the empire to
British over foreign shipowners; and
they nursed up, accordingly, the immense
and hardy body of British
seamen, who have founded and protected
our colonial empire, and rendered
Great Britain the terror and
admiration of the world. What, then,
is the great benefit which is anticipated
from the repeal of laws, the
practical operation of which has been
attended with such uniform and unparalleled
benefits? The benefit is,
that it will save our merchants some
millions a-year in the payment of
freights. It is calculated by the Free-traders
that £30,000,000 yearly is paid
by Great Britain for freights; and of
this sum, it is thought a fourth, or
£7,500,000 yearly, may be saved by
the employment of foreign instead of
British sailors in the conducting of our
commerce, or the reduction of freight
and seamen's wages in these islands,
which will result from their unrestrained
competition. This is the
benefit to attain which our Navigation
Laws, the nursery of our seamen,
are to be sacrificed. And the question
to be considered is,&mdash;Is the gain real,
or apparent only; and, supposing it is
real, is it worth the risk with which
it is attended?</p>

<p>Is the advantage real, or apparent
only? Concede to the Free-traders
all they contend for: call the saving
to the nation annually in freights, to
be effected by free trade in shipping,
not £7,500,000 but £10,000,000 annually.
The strength of the argument
will admit of almost any concession.
Admit this, and consider
what it is worth, and on whom it is
made. It is not worth a <em>fiftieth part</em>
of the revenue of the nation, which,
in the produce of land and manufactures
alone, is above £500,000,000
annually. A week of sunshine in
autumn, a favourable set of Fall orders
from America, the stoppage of a revolution
in Europe, are each worth more
to the nation. But, such as it is, from
whom is it gained? Why, it is all
<em>gained from our own people</em>: it is a
saving effected to <em>one class of our inhabitants
by impoverishing another class</em>.
If our merchants and the purchasers
from them pay £20,000,000 a-year for
freight of goods sea-borne, instead of
£30,000,000 as formerly, undoubtedly
there is a saying of £10,000,000 <em>to
them</em>, or the consumers who buy from
them. But of whom is this saving
made? From whom is it derived?
Is it not from our shipbuilders, shipowners,
and seamen, who get so much
the less: either by being driven out
of the market by foreign mercantile
navies, or by getting their own profits
or wages reduced by external competition
to that amount? Ten millions
now earned by shipowners and sailors
in Great Britain, is, on the most
favourable supposition for the Free-traders,
<em>taken from them</em>, and given to
the dealers in or consumers of the
commodities which they transport.
Is the nation, as a whole, any gainer
by that transfer? If ten pounds are
taken from John and given to James,
are John and James, taken together,
any gainers by the transfer? And is
not the great family of the nation
composed of all its members, not of
John only, but of John and James
taken together? Is not the repeal of
the Navigation Laws, in this view
robbing Peter to pay Paul? This is
the mighty advantage, for the attainment
of which we are going to crush
by external competition our mercantile
shipping; and endanger the
national independence, by withering
the nursery of the navy, by which it
can alone be maintained! Can there
be a stronger proof of how completely,
by the operation of the Reform Bill,
we have fallen under the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
class government; and how entirely
such class government blinds the
vision even of the most clear-sighted,
to any thing but the perception of its
own immediate interests?</p>

<p>The evidence taken before the Commons'
committee, on the comparative
cost of building and navigating ships
in the north of Europe and in this
country, comes to this, that both are
about <em>twice</em> as expensive in this
country as on the shores of the
Baltic. A copper-sheathed vessel,
which there costs £4500, cannot here
be constructed for less than £9000:
a master's wages there, which are
£2, 11s. a month, are here £5 for the
same period: seamen's, there 7d. a
day, besides provisions, &amp;c., are here
1s. 2d. Every thing else is in the
same proportion. Shipbuilding and
ship-navigating are twice as costly
in Great Britain as they are in Norway
and Denmark. How could it be
otherwise, when they have the materials
of ships and rigging at their
doors, while we have to transport
them to the British shores from
Canada or the Baltic; and they are
the poor nations, whose money being
scarce goes far, and we are the rich
one, whose money being comparatively
plentiful goes but a little way.
Compare the cost of living in London
during the season, with what it is in
Aberdeen or Inverness, and you will
at once see the main cause of the extraordinary
difference in the value of
money, and consequently in the
money-price of articles, in the two
situations. The difference in the cost
of shipbuilding and seamanship, viz.
one half, is nearly the same as the
difference in the cost of raising sugar
in our free-labour colonies and the
foreign slave ones, which is £10 a
ton in the former situation, and
£4 in the latter. And it is in the
perfect knowledge of the entire ruin
which the approach even to a free
trade in sugar has brought, under
these circumstances, upon the British
West India islands, that government
are prepared to force a similar disastrous
competition upon the British
shipowners, and through them on the
palladium of British independence,
the royal navy.</p>

<p>Mr Labouchere said, in the debate
on this subject in the House of Commons,
that the Protection Party
seemed to consider every importation
as in itself an evil, inasmuch as it
displaced a corresponding amount of
native industry; but that till he found
that goods were brought by merchants
into the country for nothing, he never
could see how importation did not encourage
domestic industry as much as
home orders. This is manfully spoken:
it comes home to the kernel of the question.
It is pleasing to have to contend
with such an antagonist. We will answer
him equally briefly, and, as it seems
to us, decisively. The difference between
home orders and foreign orders
is this, that the one encourages industry
at <em>both ends</em>, viz., in the consumers
and the producers; the other, at <em>one
end only</em>, viz., in the consumer. This
difference, however, may become vital
to the national fortunes. If a London
merchant pays £20,000 a-year to
British shipowners and seamen, he
keeps in motion at once the industry
of the consumers, by whose produce
the freights are ultimately paid, and
the industry of the seafaring classes
by whom they are earned. But if he
pays the £20,000 a-year not to British
but foreign shipowners, the only
industry put in motion, so far as we
are concerned, is that which raises the
produce which is to pay the freight.
The other end of the chain is placed
in Norway or America, and any encouragement
to industry there afforded
is wholly lost to England. It is just
the difference between rents spent in
Great Britain, and rents spent in
Paris or Naples.</p>

<p>Doubtless they are the same thing,
so far as the whole world is concerned;
but are they the same thing so far as
that portion of the world in which we
are interested, viz., the British Islands,
is concerned? Unquestionably they
are not. What the Protectionists say
is, not that no British industry is encouraged
when importation takes
place: they know perfectly it is encouraged
at <em>their end</em> of the line;
what they say is, that it is not encouraged
at the <em>other end</em>, because that
other end rests in foreign states; and
that it is unwise to encourage industry
at <em>one end</em> only, when it is possible
to do so at <em>both</em>. Adam Smith saw this
perfectly when he so well explained the
difference between the home trade and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
foreign trade, and said the former was
"worth all foreign trade put together."
But his observations on this head are
as much forgotten by the majority of
our legislators as those he made on the
great wisdom of our Navigation Laws,
as the only security for our national
independence.</p>

<p>Mr M'Gregor said in debate on the
same subject, that "he admitted our
naval strength had co-existed with
the Navigation Laws, but he denied
that they were cause and effect. They
had about as much to do with each other
as the height of the Pyramids had with
the floods of the Nile."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> We agree with
the honourable member for Glasgow
in one part of this observation. The
Navigation Laws have had as much to
do with our maritime prosperity as the
Pyramids had with the floods of the
Nile; and we will tell the ex-secretary
of the board of trade what the relation
was&mdash;it was that of cause and effect. Mr
M'Gregor is too well informed not to
know that there exists in Cairo a
<em>Nilometer</em>, and that, during the period
of the inundation, the spirits of the
people and the animation of commerce
rise and fall with the rise or fall of
the prolific stream. It is no wonder
they do so, for it is the source of life
and prosperity to the whole community.
Raised by the power of the
Pharaohs from the riches produced by
the inundations of former times, the
Pyramids are the Nilometer of antiquity,
as much as the tower of Babel
and the ruins of Babylon were the monument
of the opulence of the plain
of Shinar; or as Waterloo Bridge is of
the wealth produced by the favourable
maritime situation of London, or York
Cathedral of the agricultural riches of
the plains of Yorkshire. In all these
causes there is a relation between the
natural advantages which produce the
riches and the durable monument to
the construction of which they lead,
and that relation is that of cause and
effect. We entirely concur with the
member for Glasgow in thinking that
the same connexion, and no other,
subsists between the Navigation Laws
and the maritime greatness of England
as existed formerly between the
Pyramids of Egypt and the fertilising
floods which encircle their base.</p>

<p>To prove that these remarks are
not made at random, but that the Navigation
Laws really are the foundation
of the maritime greatness of England,
and that, when they are repealed,
it must of necessity languish and
ultimately expire, we subjoin three
tables: one showing the progress
of British as compared with foreign
shipping, from 1801 to 1823, when
the protection of the Navigation Laws
was first infringed upon by the adoption
of the reciprocity system with the
Baltic powers; and another showing
the comparative progress of our
foreign and home shipping with
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and
Prussia, the countries with whom
reciprocity treaties were first concluded,
from 1823 to the end of 1847,
when the reciprocity system had been
a quarter of a century in operation.</p>

<p><br />Thus, while our shipping with the
whole world <em>quadrupled</em>, as compared
with the foreign employed in the same
trade, under the protective system,
from 1801 to 1823; it declined under
the reciprocity system of equal duties,
in the countries to which that system
was applied in the next twenty years,
till it had dwindled to a perfect fraction;&mdash;our
tonnage with Sweden being,
in 1847, not more than a <em>sixteenth</em> part
of the foreign; with Norway, a <em>fiftieth</em>
part; with Denmark somewhat above
a <em>sixth</em>; with Prussia somewhat under
a <em>fourth</em>.</p>

<p>But then it is said these are <em>selected</em>
states which do not give a fair average
of the reciprocity system, or afford a
correct criterion of its probable effects
when applied, as it is about to be by a
general repeal of the Navigation Laws,
to the whole world. If they are
"selected states," we can only say
they were selected by Mr Huskisson
and the Free-traders themselves
as likely to afford the best specimen of
the effect of their principles, and therefore
as the first on which the experiment
was to be made. But we are quite
willing to take the general tonnage of
the empire as the test; and we shall
commence with a quotation from the
tables of the great statistical apostle of
free trade, Mr Porter, to show the
effect of free trade in shipping on the
comparative growth of our whole tonnage,
as compared with that of foreign
states, from 1801 to 1823, when the
reciprocity system began; and again
from thence lo 1847, when free trade
in shipping was in full operation by
the temporary suspension of the Navigation
Laws, from the effect of the Orders
in Council in March 1847 suspending
the Navigation Laws under the
pressure of the Irish famine:&mdash;</p>

<p>It appears from this most instructive
table that, under the protection system,
from 1801 to 1823, the British
shipping employed in conducting our
commerce had gained so decisively
on the foreign employed in the same
commerce, that it had increased, from
having been on an average of five years,
at the commencement of the second,
about two British tons to one foreign,
to be, on the last five years, about
<em>four</em> British tons to one foreign: in
other words, during these twenty-two
years, the proportion of British to
foreign shipping had <em>doubled</em>.</p>

<p>Turn now to the contrast afforded
by the comparative progress of British
and foreign shipping from 1823, when
the reciprocity system was introduced
with certain states, to 1847, when it
was made universal by the suspension
of the Navigation Laws in March of
that year:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p><br />Thus it appears that under the
reciprocity system with some countries
since 1823, and free trade in shipping
with all in 1847, the foreign shipping
employed in carrying on the British
trade had so rapidly grown upon the
British, that, while at the commencement
of the period the British stood
to the foreign as 174 to 58, or <em>3 to 1</em>
exactly, at the close they stood as 49
to 22, or <em>somewhat above 2 to 1 only</em>.
And observe the vast start of foreign
shipping as compared with British,
since free trade was introduced by Sir
R. Peel in 1846. For while the British
tonnage was to the foreign in 1845 as
43 to 17, or as 2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> to 1; in the year
1847 it was as 49 to 229, or 2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>3</small></sub> to 1 only.
So rapid has been the growth of foreign
shipping over British in eighteen
months of general free trade. In
ten years of such a system, it is
easy to see that the foreign tonnage
employed in carrying on our trade
will be equal to the British; and then
our national independence is gone for
ever, for we have nursed up in our
harbours a body of foreign seamen
equal to our own.</p>

<p>But we have not yet done with the
parliamentary returns. From the
return 3d April 1848, it appears that
the total tonnage, British and foreign,
employed in carrying on our trade
was&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus the British trade to our colonial
settlements is about <em>a hundred
times</em> the foreign, and constitutes
nearly a <em>third</em> of the whole tonnage
employed in carrying on our commerce,
and about two-fifths of the
total British tonnage,&mdash;(1,970,372 out
of 4,942,094.)</p>

<p>But it is important to discover
what proportion the British tonnage
employed in conducting our trade
with all the world, <em>except our colonies</em>,
bears to the foreign tonnage employed
in the same work. That is easily
found:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>So that, setting aside our colonial
trade, the British tonnage is to the
tonnage with all the rest of the world
as 29 to 22, or as 4 to 3 only! Considering
the rapid strides which, under
the reciprocity system established
only with a limited number of countries
in 1823, the foreign shipping is
making in encroachment upon the
British, this fact affords room for the
most serious reflections. It is clear,
from the great advance of foreign over
British shipping in the single year of
temporary suspension of the Navigation
Laws, under the pressure of famine
in 1847&mdash;viz. from 1,735,679, to
2,253,979; while the British in the
same period advanced only from
4,310,639, to 4,942,094,&mdash;that two or
three years of free trade in shipping
will bring the foreign vessels employed
in conducting our trade, exclusive of
those engaged in the colonial, to an
<em>equality with the British</em>. The moment
that period arrives, our maritime
superiority, and with it our national
independence, hang entirely on our
colonial trade, which, and which alone,
strikes the balance at present in our
favour. And yet, the colonial trade
is the precise thing which it is the
object of the repeal of the Navigation
Laws to throw open to foreign nations!
In their anxiety to cheapen every
thing, the Free-traders would gladly
expose our shipping interest engaged in
the colonial trade to the same competition,
which has already proved so disastrous
to that part of it which is engaged
in the traffic with foreign nations.</p>

<p>Observe how one false step in policy
by nations, like one deviation from
virtue in private life, leads by natural
consequences to a repetition of errors
and crimes, till irreparable ruin ensues.
The agricultural interest at
home was first attacked; and by the
cry of cheap bread, and the weight of
class legislation, its protection was
taken away. The West India islands
were the next victims; because, if
the farmer in England raises his
wheat with nothing but a nominal
protection, it was plausible to say the
West India planter must raise his
sugar on the same terms. The ruinous
competition to which this exposed the
West India planters naturally produced
in them a desire to be liberated
from any burdens to which they were
subjected for the benefit of the mother
country; and in this demand the
Canadians, exposed to the competition
of American grain, for a similar
reason concurred. Thus the cry for
cheap freights, originating in free-trade
principles in England, came to be
responded to from the British colonies
on the other side of the Atlantic; and
the Navigation Laws began to be repudiated
by the colonies&mdash;the very thing
which formerly it was their most
anxious desire to uphold. The firm
though unseen bond of mutual interest,
founded on protective principles,
which has hitherto held together the
vast and widely separated dominions
of the British empire, is dissolved.
Being deprived of the benefit of
protection, they very naturally wished
to be relieved of its burdens. Such
is the maze of error and danger into
which we have been led by the
sophistry of free trade; and such the
way in which the greatest and best
consolidated empires are first loosened,
and then destroyed, by the delusions
of those entrusted with their guidance.</p>

<p>The manner in which foreign shipping
has encroached upon British, since
the reciprocity system began in 1823, is
clearly proved by the centesimal proportions
of each, published by Mr Porter,
from 1820 to 1844, both inclusive.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the following
table, that, since 1820, the centesimal
proportion of British shipping employed
in conducting our trade has
<em>declined</em> from 78 to 72, while that of
foreign nations has <em>increased</em> from 21
to 27. But this proportion, such as
it is, is solely upheld by our colonial
trade, which, as already shown, employs
nearly 2,000,000 tons of our
shipping. But for it, the encroachment
of foreign on British shipping would
appear in such alarming colours as to
strike the most inconsiderate. It is
the rapid growth of our colonial trade
under the protective system which has
alone concealed the ravages effected
on it by free trade under the reciprocity.</p>

<p><br />Such has been the working of the
reciprocity system, as compared with
the protective and colonial&mdash;in other
words, free trade in shipping with
some particular nations&mdash;in twenty
years. And it is from this experience
of the effects of the partial adoption of
these principles that the Free-traders
now propose to make it universal!</p>

<p>America is the country to which,
in comparison with Great Britain, the
Free-traders constantly refer for a
demonstration of the justice and beneficial
operation of their principles. We
accept the instance, and proceed to
inquire into the comparative value of
the American protected trade with
our own colonies, and the American
free trade with the United States, both
at this time and in the respective progress
of each for the last twenty-five
years.</p>

<p>The foreign and British tonnage
with the United States, Canada, and
the West Indies, in the year 1847,
stood thus, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;<cite>Parliamentary Paper, 3d April 1848.</cite>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p><br />So that, while our West India and
North American colonies, under this
Protective system, support 1,196,854
tons of British shipping against 3,724
of foreign, or 300 to 1 nearly; the
American trade with the United States
only maintains 437,095 of British
against 651,189 of foreign; in other
words, about 2 to 3 nearly! But the
Free-traders think it better to adopt
the system which makes the foreign
shipping to the British as 3 to 2, than
uphold the one which has brought the
foreign shipping to the British, in the
colonial trade, as 1 to 300!</p>

<p>Observe, too, the decisive proof
which the same return affords of the
vast superiority, in every point of
view, of our colonial trade to our
foreign, even in the hands of our best
free-trade customers, the Americans.
For while less than 3,000,000 of souls
between the West India and North
American colonies furnished employment
to 1,197,000 tons of British and
foreign shipping, of which 1,193,000
was British; twenty millions of Americans
in the United States only furnished
employment to 1,088,284 tons
of shipping, in all of which no more
than 437,095 were British! And this
is the pet instance of the Free-traders&mdash;their
favourite <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheval de bataille</i>&mdash;to
demonstrate the great superiority of
free and foreign over protected and
colonial trade!</p>

<p>Again, if we take the comparative
progress of British and American tonnage
in conducting the trade of the
United States, since the reciprocity
system was begun in 1823, the same
conclusion is forced upon the mind.
Not only is the American shipping,
throughout the whole period, superior
to the British in the proportion generally
of 3 to 1, but this superiority
in their favour remains undiminished
in any material degree. We take the
following returns from Mr Porter:&mdash;</p>

<p><br />It is easy to see how it has happened
that, in competition with the
shipowners of every country, the British
shipowners have suffered so much
under the partial operation of the
free-trade principles which the reciprocity
system has afforded. It is the
inevitable fate of the old and the
rich state, in shipbuilding and agriculture,
to be undersold by the young
and the poor one. The reason is,
that the old state, by the very magnitude
of its wealth, the amount of its
transactions, the number of its inhabitants,
the multitude of its fabrics,
is obliged to pay much higher for
labour and materials of all sorts than
the young and the poor one. Machinery
and the steam-engine compensate,
and more than compensate,
this superiority in regard to manufactured
articles. England undersells
Hindostan, where wages are a penny
or twopence a day, by the work of
steam-power looms working on cotton
raised on the banks of the Ganges.
But there is no steam-power loom in
shipbuilding any more than in agriculture.
Great things in nautical
affairs, as in rural economy, can be
effected only by the labour of man's
hands and the sweat of his brow, in
the last ages of civilisation, as in the
first. It would appear to be a permanent
law of nature, to which there
is no exception in any age of the
world, or any stage of human progress,
that the chief branches of industry on
which the subsistence and defence of
nations rest&mdash;agriculture, and the
naval and military arts&mdash;are pursued
more cheaply, and with more success
by young and rising than old and
opulent states. History is full of examples
in which the manufactures of
rich and ancient nations have obtained
an undisputed supremacy over the
fabrics of poor and rising ones; but it
presents still more examples of the
encroachments made on the industry
and power of old nations by the agricultural
produce, or naval and military
efforts, of young ones. It is this
law of nature which provides for the
decay and ruin of nations when they
are approaching the limit of their
allotted space of existence, and should
give place to others entering on the
career which they have terminated.
No efforts of human energy or virtue
can prolong, for any considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
period, this allotted space. But it is
the peculiar reproach of free trade,
whether applied to agriculture or
nautical affairs, that it tends to
shorten, instead of prolonging, the
life of the nation to which it is applied,
by oppressing instead of relieving
those vital branches of industry
on which its existence depends, and
thus both aggravates the natural evils
incident to old age, and accelerates
the approach of the political society
to the tomb.</p>

<p>When Mr Huskisson, in 1823, introduced
the Reciprocity System, he did
not dispute that it would injure our
maritime interests; but he contended
that it would open a new field for our
manufactures,&mdash;that the time had now
arrived when the Protective System
could no longer be maintained, and it
had become indispensable to sacrifice
to a certain extent our maritime interests,
in order to preserve the chief
vents on Continental Europe for the
industry of our artisans. The sacrifice
was made, and the tables already
given show with what fatal effect to
our shipping interest. Has it extended
the market for our manufactures, or
diminished the jealousy with which
they are regarded by the states of
Continental Europe? Let the Zollverein
league, at the head of which
Prussia has placed herself, and which
has imposed duties to an amount, in
practical operation, of fifty per cent
on our manufactures, give the answer.
The exports which we send to the
states of Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
and Prussia, are still, after a quarter
of a century's experience of the immense
impulse it has given to their
maritime interests, and corresponding
depression to ours, a perfect trifle.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Our exports to America are less than
they were fifteen years ago, despite
the boasted conciliatory effect of
twenty years' reciprocity.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> What can
be more injudicious, therefore, than to
persist in, and even extend, a system
which, without diminishing in the
slightest degree the jealousy of Continental
nations at our manufacturing
superiority, has inflicted a serious and
gratuitous wound on the naval resources
by which alone that superiority
can be maintained?</p>

<p>We have recently made a very great
stride in free-trade principles, by the
sacrifice of our agricultural protection,
and the throwing open the English
markets to cultivators of all nations.
In the three last months of 1846 and
even of 1847, in consequence of the
import duties being removed, above
£30,000,000 sterling was sent out
of the country to purchase foreign
grain; and the moderate duty of eight
shillings a quarter has since been reimposed
on wheat,&mdash;yet it terminates
in February next, and corn from all
quarters will then be admitted for the
nominal duty of one shilling a quarter.
We have abandoned the protection
of our colonies to conciliate the slave-growing
states, and augment the market
for Manchester goods in Cuba and
Brazil. With what disastrous effects
these changes have been attended,
upon the best interests of the empire,
need be told to none who are familiar
with the total ruin which has in consequence
overtaken our West India
colonies, and the unprecedented distress
which prevails in all the great
seats of our manufacturing industry.
The loss of half the realised wealth of
Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow,
and the creation of nearly a hundred
thousand persons, including dependants,
in a state of pauperism, in each
of those once rich and prosperous
cities, is the price which, in a year and
a half, we have paid for the adoption
by Sir R. Peel of Mr Cobden's principles
of free trade, and Mr Jones
Loyd's principles of a fettered currency.
Have we, in consequence,
reaped any countervailing advantage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
or does the increase of our export
and import trade show any benefit
derived to the nation, to compensate
such dreadful wounds inflicted on its
internal prosperity, in the attempt to
disarm the jealousy of foreign manufacturers?
So far from it, our exports
and imports have steadily
<em>declined</em> since free-trade principles
were introduced. All the main sources
of our strength have diminished since
Sir R. Peel abandoned protection in
July 1846.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In adopting these principles,
we have gratuitously inflicted
a grievous wound on our own people,
without having obtained for them the
shadow even of a benefit to compensate
the evil.</p>

<p>Such have been the effects of free-trade
principles on the comparative
prosperity of British and foreign shipping,
on the showing of the Free-traders
themselves, and according to
the figures which their great statistician,
Mr Porter, has prepared and
published at the Board of Trade. We
were unwilling to mix up a great national
question, such as the repeal of
the Navigation Laws, with any subordinate
examination as to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of the view of our maritime
affairs which these figures exhibit.
Such is the strength of the case, that
it will admit of almost any concession;
and the opponents of their repeal have
no occasion to go farther than to the
statistics of their adversaries for the
most decisive refutation of their principles.
But there are two observations
on the tables published by the
Board of Trade, so important that
they cannot be passed over in silence.
The first is, that in 1834, when Mr
Poulett Thomson was president of
the Board of Trade, a regulation was
made by the Board as to the measurement
of vessels, which had the effect
of adding <em>a fifth</em> to the apparent tonnage
of all British vessels, subsequent
to that date. This change was clearly
proved by the witnesses examined
before the Commons' committee; but
though Mr Porter, in his last edition
of the <cite>Progress of the Nation</cite>, mentions
the change, (p. 368,) he makes
no allusion to it in comparing the
amount of British and foreign tonnage
since 1834. Of course a fifth must
be deducted from British tonnage, as
compared with foreign, since that
time; and what overwhelming force
does this give to the facts, already
strong, in regard to the effect of the
reciprocity system on our maritime
interests!</p>

<p>The second is, that the tonnage
with countries near Great Britain,
such as France, Belgium, and Holland,
<em>includes steam vessels</em> carrying
passengers, and their repeated voyages.
In this way a boat, measuring
148 tons, and carrying passengers
chiefly, comes to figure in the returns
for 24,000 tons! It is evident that
this important circumstance deprives
the returns of such near states of all
value in the estimate of the comparative
amount of tonnage engaged in
the trade with different countries.
That with France will appear greatest
in spring 1848, in consequence of the
number of large vessels then employed
in bringing back English residents
expelled by, or terrified at, the Revolution&mdash;though
that circumstance was
putting a stop to nearly all the commercial
intercourse between the two
countries. As steam navigation has
so immensely increased since 1834,
when the changes in the measurement
was introduced&mdash;and Great Britain,
from its store of coal and iron, enjoys
more of that traffic than all Europe put
together&mdash;this is another circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
which militates against the returns as
exhibiting a fair view of our trade,
compared with that of foreign nations,
especially with near countries, and
fully justifies Mr Porter's admission,
when examined before the Lords'
committee, that "considerable fallacy
is to be found in the returns." Unfortunately
for the Free-traders, however,
who had the preparation of them
in their hands, these fallacies all point
one way&mdash;viz. to augment the apparent
advantages of free trade in shipping.</p>

<p>Such as free-trade principles are,
they are evidently not likely to remain,
if these islands are excepted,
long in the ascendant either in the
Old or the New World. The American
tariff shows us how little we have to
expect from Transatlantic favour to
our manufactures: the savage expulsion
of English labourers from France,
how far the principles of "Liberty,
Equality, and <em>Fraternity</em>," are likely
to be acted upon by our enthusiastic
and democratic neighbours on the
Continent of Europe. It is clear
from the communist and socialist
principles now in the ascendant, both
at Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, that
the interests of <em>labour</em> will above all
things be considered by their governments
in future times, and that the
most rigorous measures, in the form
of fiscal regulations, if not <em>absolute
prohibition</em>, may shortly be expected
in France, Italy, and Germany,
against manufactures of any sort
which interfere, or seem to interfere,
with the interests of the dominant
multitude of operatives. Why does our
government adhere so strongly, in the
face of the clearest evidence of their
ruinous tendency, to the present system
of free trade and a fettered currency?
Because it works well for the great
capitalists, who desire to have money
dear, and the great manufacturers,
who wish to have labour cheap, and
because a majority of the House of
Commons has been placed by the Reform
Bill under their influence. Give
the operatives the majority, and the
opposite interest will instantly prevail.
A successful Chartist revolt
would at once send the whole free
trade and fettered currency measures
by the board in three months. In truth,
it is the disasters they have produced
which has revived Chartism, and
rendered it so menacing in the land.
We should like to see how long a
legislature, elected by universal suffrage,
would allow Spitalfields and
Macclesfield to be pauperised by Lyons
silks, and Manchester invaded by
Rouen cottons, and the shipwrights of
Hull and Sunderland to be ruined by
Baltic shipbuilders. As the operative
classes have obtained the ascendency
in the principal Continental states, a
similar jealousy of foreign interference
with industry may with certainty be
looked for in Continental Europe. Can
any thing be more insane, therefore,
than to persist in a policy fraught, as
every thing around us demonstrates,
with such ruinous social injury to ourselves,
and which the progress of political
change on the Continent renders
incapable of producing the ultimate
benefits, in exchange for those evils
which their authors hold out as the inducing
causes of the measures which
have produced them?</p>

<p>While the political changes which
have recently occurred on the Continent
of Europe have rendered any reciprocity
of advantages utterly hopeless
from the most violent adoption of
free-trade principles, they have augmented
in a proportional degree the
dangers to this country of foreign aggression,
and the risk to be apprehended
from any diminution of our
naval resources. The days have
gone by when the dream of a free-trade
millenium, in which a reciprocity
of advantages is to extinguish all
feelings of hostility, and war is to be
looked back to as a relic of the pre-Adamite
world, can with safety be indulged.
It is rather too late to think
of the termination of the angry passions
of men, when Europe, in its
length and breadth, is devastated alike
by civil dissension and foreign warfare;
when barricades have so recently
been erected in all its chief capitals;
when bloodshed is hourly expected in
Paris and Berlin; when the Emperor
of Austria has fled to Innspruck; when
every station in London was, only a
few days ago, occupied by armed battalions;
and when a furious war,
rousing the passions of whole races
of men, is raging on the Mincio and
the Elbe. Threatened by a raging
fire in all the countries by which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
are surrounded, uncertain whether we
are not slumbering on the embers of a
conflagration in our own, is this the
time to relax in our warlike preparations,
and, by crippling the nursery of
our seamen, expose ourselves, without
the means of resistance, to the assaults
of hostile nations, envious of our fame,
jealous of our manufactures, covetous
of our wealth, desirous of our ruin?</p>

<p>While Western Europe is torn by
revolutionary passions, and the seeds
of a dreadful, because a popular and
general war, are rapidly springing to
maturity from the Seine to the Vistula,
Russia is silently but unceasingly
gathering up its giant strength, and
the Czar has already 300,000 men,
and 800 pieces of cannon, ready to take
the field against the revolutionary enthusiasts
of France and Germany.
Sooner or later the conflict must arrive.
It is not unlikely that either a
second Napoleon will lead another
crusade of the western nations across
the Niemen, or a second Alexander
will conduct the forces of the desert
to the banks of the Seine. Whichever
proves victorious, England has equal
cause for apprehension. If the balance
of power is subverted on Continental
Europe, how is the independence of
this country to be maintained? How
are our manufactures or revenue to
be supported, if one prevailing power
has subjugated all the other states of
Europe to its sway? It is hard to
say whether, in such circumstances,
we should have most to dread from
French fraternity or Russian hostility.
But how is the balance of power to be
preserved in Europe amidst the wreck
of its principal states? when Prussia
is revolutionised, and has passed over
to the other side; when Austria is
shattered and broken in pieces, and
Italy has fallen under the dominion of
a faction, distinguished beyond any
thing else by its relentless hatred of
the aristocracy, and jealousy of the
fabrics of England? What has Great
Britain to rely on in such a crisis but
the energy of its seamen and the might
of its navy, which might at least enable
it to preserve its connexion with
its own colonies, and maintain, as
during the Continental blockade, its
commerce with Transatlantic nations?
And yet this is the moment which our
rulers have selected for destroying the
Navigation Laws, so long the bulwark
of our mercantile marine, and permitting
all the world to make those inroads
on our shipping, which have already
been partially effected by the nations
with whom we have concluded reciprocity
treaties!</p>

<p>The defence of Great Britain must
always mainly rest on our navy, and
our navy is almost entirely dependent
on the maintenance of our colonies.
It is in the trade with the colonies
that we can alone look for the means
of resisting the general coalition of
the European powers, which is certain,
sooner or later, to arise against our
maritime superiority, and the advent
of which the spread of democratic
principles, and the sway of operative
jealousy on the Continent, is so evidently
calculated to accelerate. But
how are our colonies to be preserved,
even for a few years, if free-trade
severs the strong bond of interest which
has hitherto attached them to the
mother country, and the repeal of the
Navigation Laws accustoms them to
look to foreigners for the means of
conducting their mercantile transactions?
Charged with the defence of
a colonial empire which encircles the
earth, and has brought such countless
treasures and boundless strength to
the parent state, Great Britain at
land is only a fourth-rate power, at
least for Continental strife. At Waterloo,
even, she could only array forty-five
thousand men to contend with
the conqueror of Europe for her existence.
It is in our ships we must
look for the means of maintaining our
commerce, and asserting our independence
against manufacturing jealousy,
national rivalry, and foreign
aggression. Is our navy, then, to be
surrendered to the ceaseless encroachments
of foreigners, in order to effect
a saving of a few millions a-year on
freights, reft from our own people,
and sapping the foundations of our
national independence?</p>

<p>How can human wisdom or foresight,
the energy of the Anglo-Saxons,
or the courage of the Normans, maintain,
for any length of time, our independence
in the perilous position into
which free-trade policy has, during the
short period it has been in operation,
brought us? The repeal of the Corn
Laws has already brought an importation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of eight or ten millions of foreign
quarters annually upon our people&mdash;a
full sixth of the national subsistence,
and which will soon become indispensable
to their existence. A simple
non-intercourse act will alone enable
Russia or America, without firing a
shot, to compel us to lower the
flag of Blake and Nelson. Stern
famine will "guard the solitary coast,"
and famished multitudes demand
national submission as the price of
life. The repeal of the Navigation
Laws will ere long bring the foreign
seamen engaged in carrying on our
trade to a superiority over our own, as
has already taken place in so woful
a manner with the Baltic powers.
Hostile fleets will moor their ships of
the line across our harbours, and
throw back our starving multitudes
on their own island for food, and their
own market for employment. What
will then avail our manufacturers and
our fabrics,&mdash;the forges of Birmingham,
the power-looms of Manchester,
the iron-works of Lanarkshire,&mdash;if
the enemies' squadrons blockade the
Thames, the Mersey, and the Clyde,
and famished millions are deprived
alike of food and employment, by the
suicidal policy of preceding rulers?
Our present strength will then be the
measure of our weakness; our vast
population, as in a beleaguered town,
the useless multitude which must be
fed, and cannot fight,&mdash;our wealth,
the glittering prize which will attract
the rapacity of the spoiler. With indignant
feelings, but caustic truth,
our people will then curse the infatuated
policy which abandoned the
national defences, and handed them
over, bound hand and foot, to the
enemy, only the more the object of rapacity
because such boundless wealth
had accumulated in a few hands
amongst them. Then will be seen,
that with our own hands, as into the
ancient city, we have admitted the enemies'
bands; we have drawn the horse
pregnant with armed men through our
ramparts, and our weeping and dispersed
descendants will exclaim with
the Trojans of old&mdash;</p>
